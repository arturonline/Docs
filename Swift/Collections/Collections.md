# Collections

Arrays are ordered collections of values. Sets are unordered collections of unique values. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value associations.

## Mutability

if you create an array, set or a dictionary, and assign it to a variable, the collection will be mutable. This means that you can change:

- Add elements
- Remove elements
- Change elements

But if you assign the collection to a constant, that collection is immutable, and its size and contents cannot be changed.
