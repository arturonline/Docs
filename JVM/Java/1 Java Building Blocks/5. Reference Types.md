# Reference types

A reference type do not hold the value of the object they refer to. Instead, a reference *“points”* to an object by storing the memory address where the object is located.

An object cannot be assigned to another object, nor can an object be passed to a method or returned from a method. You pass its reference.

A value is assigned to a reference type in one of two ways:

* A reference can be assigned to another object of the same type.
* A reference can be assigned to a new object using the **new** keyword.

Reference types can be assigned **null**, which means they do not currently refer to an object. Primitive types will give you a compiler error if you attempt to assign them null.

```java
int value = null; // DOES NOT COMPILE
String s = null;
```

Reference types can be used to call methods when they do not point to null. In this example, we can call a method on reference since it is of a reference type.

```java
String reference = "hello";
int len = reference.length();
int bad = len.length(); // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

No methods exist on `len` because it is an `int` primitive. Primitives do not have methods.
