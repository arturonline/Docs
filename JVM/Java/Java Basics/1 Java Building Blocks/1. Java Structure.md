# Java Structure

Java code is organized into folders called packages. To reference classes in other packages, you use an import statement.

## Package, import and class

- Order: package, import, and class.
- Package declaration are optional.
- Import declarations are optional.

## Java files

- You can have any number of classes in a Java file.
- Each java source file should contain only one **public** class.
- The public class matches the name of the file.
- It's perfectly fine to have a file that does not contain a public class.

## Compiling java files

- To compile Java code, the file must have the extension `.java`.
- When we execute `javac`, the result is a file of bytecode by the same name, but with a `.class` filename extension.
- We must omit the `.class` extension to run `Zoo.java` because the period has a reserved meaning in the JVM.

```bash
javac Hello.java
ls
$ Hello.java Hello.class
java Hello
$ Hello, Java!
```

## The main method

A Java program begins execution with its `main()` method.

```java
public class Zoo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
    }
}
```

In practice, you can write:

```Java
 String[] args
 String args[]
 String... args
 ```

 the compiler accepts any of these.
