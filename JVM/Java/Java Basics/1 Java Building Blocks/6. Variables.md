# Variables

## Declare a variable

`int numberAnimals;`

## Declare and initialize a variable

`int numberAnimals = 100;`

## Declare multiple variables

You can declare many variables in the same declaration as long as they are all of the same type. You can also initialize any or all of those values inline.

`String s1, s2;`

`String s3 = "yes", s4 = "no";`

**Tricky declarations**
`int i1, i2, i3 = 0; // Only i3 is initialized`

`int num, String value; // DOES NOT COMPILE`
It tries to declare multiple variables of different types in the same statement.

`boolean b1, b2;` OK

`String s1 = "1", s2;` OK

`double d1, double d2;` NO OK

If you want to declare multiple variables in the same statement, they must share the same type declaration and not repeat it. *double d1, d2;* would have been legal.

`int i1; int i2;`

OK

`int i3; i4;`

The second one is not a valid declaration because it omits the type.
