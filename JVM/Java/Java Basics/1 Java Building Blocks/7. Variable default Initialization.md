# Variables: default initialization

## Local Variables

A local variable is a variable defined within a method. Local variables must be initialized before use. They do not have a default value and contain garbage data until initialized. The compiler will not let you read an uninitialized value.

The compiler is also smart enough to recognize initializations that are more complex.

Eg:
Initialization after declaration, before use:

```java
public int valid() {
    int y = 10;
    int x; // x is declared here
    x = 3; // and initialized here
    return reply;
}
```

In this example, there are two branches of code. answer is initialized in both of them so the compiler is perfectly happy:

```java
public void findAnswer(boolean check) { 
    int answer;
    int onlyOneBranch;

    if (check) {
        onlyOneBranch = 1;
        answer = 1;
    } else {
        answer = 2;
    }
    System.out.println(answer);
    System.out.println(onlyOneBranch); // DOES NOT COMPILE }
```

## Instance & class Variables

Instance and class variables do not require you to initialize them. As soon as you declare these variables, they are given a default value:
