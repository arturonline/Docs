# Identifiers

The same rules for identifers apply to anything you are free to name, including variables, methods, classes, and fields.

There are only three rules to remember for legal identifers:

* The name must begin with a letter or the symbol **$** or **_**
* Subsequent characters may also be **numbers**.
* You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.
* Java is case sensiive, so you can use versions of the keywords that only differ in case.

## Exemples

The following examples are legal:

```Java
okidentifier
$OK2Identifier
```

These examples are not legal:

```Java
3DPointClass // identifiers cannot begin with a number
 hollywood@vine // @ is not a letter, digit, $
 \*$coffee // \* is not a letter, digit, $
 public // public is a reserved word*
```
