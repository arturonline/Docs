# Variables Scope

## Local variables Scope

* Local variables are declared within a method.
* Local variables can never have a scope larger than the method they are defined in.
* When you see a set of braces ({ }) in the code, it means you have entered a new block of code. Each block of code has its own scope.

## Instance variables Scope

They are available as soon as they are defined and last for the entire lifetime of the object itself.

## Static variables Scope

They go into scope when declared like the other variables types. However, they stay in scope for the entire life of the program.
