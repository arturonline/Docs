# Primitive Types

Primitive types hold their values in the memory where the variable is allocated.

* When a number is present in the code, it is called a literal. By default, Java assumes you are defining an int value with a literal.
* The integer types in Java are **byte**, **short**, **int**, and **long**.
* Integer literals are 32-bit int values unless they end with the character L or l, in which case they are 64-bit **long** values
* Real numbers in Java are represented with the **float** and **double** data types.
* Floating-point literals can also use exponential, or scientific, notation, in which a number is followed by the letter e or E (for exponent) and another number. This second number represents the power of ten by which the first number is multiplied.
* Floating-point literals are **double** values by default. To include a float value literally in a program, follow the number by the character f or F

* byte: -128, 127
* short: -32.768, 32767
* int: -2,147,483,648 .. 2,147,483,647
* long: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 .. 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
* float: 3.40282347 x 1038, 1.40239846 x 10-45
* Double: 1.7976931348623157 x 10308, 4.9406564584124654 x 10-324

You won’t need to convert between number systems on the exam. You’ll have to recognize valid literal values that can be assigned to numbers:

`long: 10000L`

`float: 1.23e100f, -1.23e-100f, .3f, 3.14F`

`double: 123.4`

`Decimal: 56`

`Binari: 0b11`

`Octal: 017`

`Hex: 0x1F`

## new notation

`int million1 = 1000000;`

`int million2 = 1_000_000;`

We’d rather be reading the latter one because the zeroes don’t run together. You can add underscores anywhere except at the beginning of a literal, the end of a literal, right before a decimal point, or right after a decimal point. Let’s look at a few examples:

`double notAtStart = _1000.00;`

`double notAtEnd = 1000.00_;`

`double notByDecimal = 1000_.00;`

`double annoyingButLegal = 1_00_0.0_0; // this one compiles`
