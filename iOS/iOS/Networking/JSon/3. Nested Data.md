# Access Nested Data

You can write an app that uses JSON from an external source or an existing local format. In either instance, you might find inconsistencies between the structure of the concepts you're modeling in your app and concepts modeled by the producer of the JSON. Sometimes, a logical bundle of data for your Swift program is spread out among several nested objects or arrays in the JSON you use. Bridge the structural gap by writing a decodable type that matches the structure of the JSON you're reading in. The decodable type serves as an intermediate type that's safe to decode. It serves as the data source in an initializer for the type that you'll use in the rest of your app.

With intermediate types, you can use the most natural types in your own code while maintaining compatibility with a variety of shapes of external JSON.

The example below introduces a type representing a grocery store and a list of the products it sells:

```Swift
import Foundation

struct GroceryStore {
    var name: String
    var products: [Product]

    struct Product: Codable {
        var name: String
        var points: Int
        var description: String?
    }
}
```

An API might supply information about grocery stores using JSON that's structured as follows:

```Swift
let json = """
[
    {
        "name": "Home Town Market",
        "aisles": [
            {
                "name": "Produce",
                "shelves": [
                    {
                        "name": "Discount Produce",
                        "product": {
                            "name": "Banana",
                            "points": 200,
                            "description": "A banana that's perfectly ripe."
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "Big City Market",
        "aisles": [
            {
                "name": "Sale Aisle",
                "shelves": [
                    {
                        "name": "Seasonal Sale",
                        "product": {
                            "name": "Chestnuts",
                            "points": 700,
                            "description": "Chestnuts that were roasted over an open fire."
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Last Season's Clearance",
                        "product": {
                            "name": "Pumpkin Seeds",
                            "points": 400,
                            "description": "Seeds harvested from a pumpkin."
                        }
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
]
""".data(using: .utf8)!
```

The JSON returned by the API contains more information than is needed to populate our GroceryStore struct. In particular, its products are nested inside aisles and shelves.

To extract the data you need from the outer containers:

1. Write a type that mirrors the shape of the source JSON and mark it as Decodable.
2. Then, write an initializer on the type you'll use in the rest of your app that takes an instance of the type that mirrors the source JSON.

In the example below, the GroceryStoreService structure serves as an intermediary between the grocery JSON and the GroceryStore structure that is ideal for its intended use in an app:

```Swift
struct GroceryStoreService: Decodable {
    let name: String
    let aisles: [Aisle]

    struct Aisle: Decodable {
        let name: String
        let shelves: [Shelf]

        struct Shelf: Decodable {
            let name: String
            let product: GroceryStore.Product
        }
    }
}
```

Because the GroceryStoreService structure matches the structure of the JSON file its conformance to the Decodable protocol is automatic.

To complete the GroceryStoreService structure's role as an intermediate type, use an extension to the GroceryStore structure. The extension adds an initializer that takes a GroceryStoreService instance and removes the unnecessary nesting by looping through and discarding the aisles and shelves:

```Swift
extension GroceryStore {
    init(from service: GroceryStoreService) {
        name = service.name
        products = []

        for aisle in service.aisles {
            for shelf in aisle.shelves {
                products.append(shelf.product)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

Using the relationships between types in the examples above, you can safely and succinctly read in JSON, pass it through the GroceryStoreService intermediate type, and use the resulting GroceryStore instances in your app:

```Swift
let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let serviceStores = try decoder.decode([GroceryStoreService].self, from: json)

let stores = serviceStores.map { GroceryStore(from: $0) }

for store in stores {
    print("\(store.name) is selling:")
    for product in store.products {
        print("\t\(product.name) (\(product.points) points)")
        if let description = product.description {
            print("\t\t\(description)")
        }
    }
}
```
