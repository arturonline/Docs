# Managing Users and Groups Info

Information about users and groups is stored in four files within the /etc/ directory tree:

`/etc/passwd`
a file of seven colon-delimited fields containing basic information about users

/etc/group
a file of four colon-delimited fields containing basic information about groups

/etc/shadow
a file of nine colon-delimited fields containing encrypted user passwords

/etc/gshadow
a file of four colon-delimited fields file containing encrypted group passwords

All of these files are updated by a suite of command-line tools for user and group management, which weâ€™ll discuss later in this lesson. They can also be managed by graphical applications, specific to each Linux distribution, which provide simpler and more immediate management interfaces.
