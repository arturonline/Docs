# Packages and Imports

## Packages

- Every Go program is made up of packages.
- Programs start running in package main.
- When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names.
- In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```
