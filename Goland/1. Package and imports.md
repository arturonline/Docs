# Packages and Imports

## Packages

- Every Go program is made up of packages.
- Programs start running in package main.
- When importing a package, you can refer only to its exported names.
- In Go, a name is exported if it begins with a capital letter.

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "math/rand"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("My favorite number is", rand.Intn(10))
}
```

## Package name conflicts

You can customize the name under which you refer to an imported package.

```go
package main

import (
    csprng "crypto/rand"
    prng "math/rand"

    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    n := prng.Int() // pseudorandom number
    b := make([]byte, 8)
    csprng.Read(b) // cryptographically secure pseudorandom number
    fmt.Println(n, b)
}
```

## Package download

The go get command downloads packages named by import paths, along with their dependencies, and then installs the packages.

```bash
go get github.com/yourbasic/graph
```

The import path corresponds to the repository hosting the code. This reduces the likelihood of future name collisions.

## Package documentation

The godoc command extracts and generates documentation for all locally installed Go programs. The following command starts a web server that presents the documentation at http://localhost:6060/.

```bash
godoc -http=:6060 &
```
