# Slices

Slices build on arrays to provide great power and convenience.
The type specification for a slice is `[]T`, where `T` is the type of the elements of the slice. Unlike an array type, a slice type has no specified length.

A slice literal is declared just like an array literal, except you leave out the element count:

```go
letters := []string{"a", "b", "c", "d"}
// does not allocate memory and s points to nil
```

A slice can be created with the built-in function called **make**, which has the signature:

```go
func make([]T, len, cap) []T
```

where **T** stands for the element type of the slice to be created. The `make` function takes a **type**, a **length**, and an optional **capacity**. When called, `make` allocates an array and returns a slice that refers to that array.

```go
var s []byte
s = make([]byte, 5, 5)
// s == []byte{0, 0, 0, 0, 0}
```

When the capacity argument is omitted, it defaults to the specified length. Here's a more succinct version of the same code:

```go
s := make([]byte, 5)
```

## Slicing

A slice can also be formed by "slicing" an existing slice or array. Slicing is done by specifying a half-open range with two indices separated by a colon:

```go
a[low : high]
```

This selects a half-open range which includes the first element, but excludes the last one.

The following expression creates a slice which includes elements 1 through 3 of a:

```go
a[1:4]
```

When slicing, you may omit the high or low bounds to use their defaults instead. The default is zero for the low bound and the length of the slice for the high bound. These slice expressions are equivalent:

```go
var a [10]int
a[0:10]
a[:10]
a[0:]
a[:]
```

## Slices are references

A slicing does not copy any data, it creates a new slice value that points to the original array. Changing the elements of a slice modifies the corresponding elements of its underlying array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    names := [4]string{
        "John",
        "Paul",
        "George",
        "Ringo",
    }
    fmt.Println(names)

    a := names[0:2]
    b := names[1:3]
    fmt.Println(a, b)

    b[0] = "XXX"
    fmt.Println(a, b)
    fmt.Println(names)
}
// [John Paul George Ringo]
// [John Paul] [Paul George]
// [John XXX] [XXX George]
// [John XXX George Ringo]
```

## Slice length and capacity

A slice has both a length and a capacity.

- The length of a slice is the number of elements it contains.
- The capacity of a slice is the number of elements in the underlying array, counting from the first element in the slice.

The length and capacity of a slice s can be obtained using the expressions `len(s)` and `cap(s)`.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	s := []int{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13}
	printSlice(s)

	// Slice the slice to give it zero length.
	s = s[:0]
	printSlice(s)

	// Extend its length.
	s = s[:4]
	printSlice(s)

	// Drop its first two values.
	s = s[2:]
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
// len=6 cap=6 [2 3 5 7 11 13]
// len=0 cap=6 []
// len=4 cap=6 [2 3 5 7]
// len=2 cap=4 [5 7]
```

## Default values

The zero value of a slice is nil.

A nil slice has a length and capacity of 0 and has no underlying array.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var s []int
	fmt.Println(s, len(s), cap(s))
	if s == nil {
		fmt.Println("nil!")
	}
}
```

## Appending to a slice

It is common to append new elements to a slice, and so Go provides a built-in append function.

```go
func append(s []T, vs ...T) []T
```

The first parameter `s` of append is a slice of type `T`, and the rest are `T` values to append to the slice.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	var s []int
	printSlice(s)

	// append works on nil slices.
	s = append(s, 0)
	printSlice(s)

	// The slice grows as needed.
	s = append(s, 1)
	printSlice(s)

	// We can add more than one element at a time.
	s = append(s, 2, 3, 4)
	printSlice(s)
}

func printSlice(s []int) {
	fmt.Printf("len=%d cap=%d %v\n", len(s), cap(s), s)
}
// len=0 cap=0 []
// len=1 cap=2 [0]
// len=2 cap=2 [0 1]
// len=5 cap=8 [0 1 2 3 4]
```

## Range

The range form of the for loop iterates over a slice or map.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

var pow = []int{1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128}

func main() {
	for i, v := range pow {
		fmt.Printf("2**%d = %d\n", i, v)
	}
}
// 2**0 = 1
// 2**1 = 2
// 2**2 = 4
// 2**3 = 8
// 2**4 = 16
// 2**5 = 32
// 2**6 = 64
// 2**7 = 128
```
