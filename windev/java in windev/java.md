# Java


In *general* it is possible to call java class methods from Windev.
1) You have to load the class --See JavaLoad
2) You can now execute a class method -- See JavaExecuteFunction


AFAIK
the called methods have to be public.
only basic datatype parameters are supported int, bool, string.... again
see Online help ->JavaExecuteFunction
The Java class run must implement the following method: " public static <Return type> <Function name>".
