## Positional parameters

| parameter | action                                       |
| --------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `$0`      | script name                                  |
| `$1 - $9` | positional argument                          |
| `$#`      | arguments number                             |
| `$*`      | get all arguments as one (better use `"$@"`) |
| `$@`      | get all arguments as one (better use `"$@"`) |
| `"$@"`      | get all arguments as one                     |
| `$?`      | result of the last execution                 |
| `$$`      | PID of the process is running                |


`"$@"` expands each positional parameter to a separate word, which makes it perfect for taking command line or function arguments in and then passing them on to another command or function. And because it expands using double quotes, it means things don't break if, say, `"$1"` contains a space or an asterisk `*`.
