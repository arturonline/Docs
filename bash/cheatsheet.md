# Bash cheatsheat

## Script creation

```sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# comment

chmod u+x my_script.sh
```

## Variables

```sh
# declaration:
name=data
```

## Double quotes vs Single quotes

```sh
$ myvar=sometext

# double quotes vs single quotes:

$ echo "double quotes gives you $myvar"
double quotes gives you sometext

$ echo 'double quotes gives you $myvar'
single quotes gives you $myvar
```

## Variable expansion

```sh
echo "$name"
echo ${name}

# Variable expansion with quotes

$ rm The secret voice in your head.mp3   # executes rm with 6 arguments

$ rm "The secret voice in your head.mp3"   # executes rm with 1 argument
```

## Command Expansion

```sh
$ echo $(seq 1 5)
1 2 3 4 5

$ echo `seq 1 5`
1 2 3 4 5
```

---

## Arithmetic Expansion

```sh
$(( expression ))
res=$(( n1+n2 ))

a=$(( 4 + 5 ))
echo $a # 9

a=$((3+5))
echo $a # 8

b=$(( a + 3 ))
echo $b # 11

b=$(( $a + 4 ))
echo $b # 12

(( b++ ))
echo $b # 13

(( b += 3 ))
echo $b # 16

a=$(( 4 * 5 ))
echo $a # 20
```

| `-eq`    | Equal to              |
| `-ne`    | Not equal             |

## Comparing Strings

| Operator | Meaning                               |
| :------: | ------------------------------------- |
| `=`      | The strings are equal                 |
| `!=`     | The strings are not equal             |
| `<`      | Less than (alphabetic order ASCII)    |
| `>`      | Greater than (alphabetic order ASCII) |
| `-n`     | String is not empty                   |
| `-z`     | String is empty                       |

## Comparing Files

| Operator          | Result                                                                 |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-e name`         | File called with the name exists                                       |
| `-f name`         | name is a regular file (not directory)                                 |
| `-s name`         | name exists, and the size is not 0                                     |
| `-d name`         | name is a directory                                                    |
| `-r name`         | has read permission in name                                            |
| `-w name`         | has write permission in name                                           |
| `-x name`         | has execution permission in name                                       |
| `file1 -nt file2` | True if `file1` is newer than (according to modification time) `file2` |
| `file1 -ot file2` | True if `file1` is older than `file2`                                  |

When they are not quoted, `$*` and `$@` are the same. You shouldn't use either of these, because they can break unexpectedly as soon as you have arguments containing spaces or wildcards.
as one
`"$@"` expands to separate words: `"$1"` `"$2"` ... This is almost always what you want. It expands each positional parameter to a separate word, which makes it perfect for taking command line or function arguments in and then passing them on to another command or function. And because it expands using double quotes, it means things don't break if, say, `"$1"` contains a space or an asterisk `*`.

## Testing Conditions with `[ ]`

ðŸ’¡Tip: `man test`

```sh
[ condition  ]

[ ! condition  ]

[ condition  ] && true-command

[ condition  ] || false-command

[ condition  ] && true-command || false-command
```

## Positional Parameters

| parameter | action                        |
| :-------: | ----------------------------- |
| `$0`      | script name                   |
| `$1 - $9` | positional argument           |
| `$#`      | how many arguments            |
| `$*`      | to get all arguments          |
| `$?`      | result of the last execution  |
| `$$`      | PID of the process is running |
