# Logical Operator

![Logical Operator](resources/logical_operator.png)

Here are some tips to help remember this table:

* AND is only true if both operands are true.
* Inclusive OR is only false if both operands are false.
* Exclusive OR is only true if the operands are different.

## Short-circuit operators **&&** and **||**

The short-circuit operators are nearly identical to the logical operators, **&** and **|**, respectively, except that the right-hand side of the expression may never be evaluated if the final result can be determined by the left-hand side of the expression. For example, consider the following statement:

```Java
boolean x = true || (y < 4);
```

Referring to the truth tables, the value **x** can only be false if both sides of the expression are false. Since we know the left-hand side is _true_, thereâ€™s no need to evaluate the right-hand side, since no value of **y** will ever make the value of x anything other than true.

Eg.:

_what is the output of the following code?_

```Java
int x = 6;
boolean y = (x >= 6) || (++x <= 7);
System.out.println(x);
```

Because x >= 6 is true, the increment operator on the right-hand side of the expression is never evaluated, so the output is 6.
