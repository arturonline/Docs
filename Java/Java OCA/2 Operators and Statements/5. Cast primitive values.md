# Casting primitive values

Casting primitives is required any time you are going from a larger numerical data type to a smaller numerical data type, or converting from a  floating-point number to an integral value.

```Java
int x = (int)1.0;
short y = (short)1921222; // Stored as 20678
int z = (int)9l;
long t = 192301398193810323L;
```

## Compound Assignment operator

```Java
long x = 10;
int y = 5;
y = y * x; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

This last line could be  fixed with an explicit cast to (int), but thereâ€™s a better way using the compound assignment operator:

```Java
long x = 10;
int y = 5;
y *= x;
```

The compound operator will first cast x to a long, apply the multiplication of two long values, and then cast the result to an int.
