# Java Initialization

* Order matters for the fields and blocks of code. You canâ€™t refer to a variable before it has been initialized.
* Fields and instance initializer blocks are run in the order in which they appear in the file.
* The constructor runs after all fields and instance initializer blocks have run.

```java
//What do you think this code prints out?

public class Egg {

    public Egg() {
        number = 5; }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Egg egg = new Egg();
        System.out.println(egg.number);
}
    private int number = 3;
    { number = 4; }
}

//If you answered 5, you got it right. Fields and blocks are run  first in order, setting number to 3 and then 4. Then the constructor runs, setting number to 5.
