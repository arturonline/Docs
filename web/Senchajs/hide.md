In ExtJS, `hide()`, `setVisible(false)`, and `setHidden(true)` are methods used to control the visibility of components, but they have some differences in their behavior and use cases:

## 1 hide()

- This method hides the component by setting its hidden property to true.
- It triggers the hide event.

## 2. setVisible(false)

- This method sets the visibility of the component to false.
- It does not trigger the hide event.


## 3. setHidden(true)

- This method sets the hidden property of the component to true.
- It is similar to `hide()`, but it does not trigger the hide event.
- It is useful when you want to control the hidden property directly.

> In most cases, `hide()` is the preferred method for hiding components as it is straightforward and triggers the appropriate events.
