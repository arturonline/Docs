# callbacks

A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function to be executed later.

```js
function greeting(name) {
  alert('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
  var name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
  callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);
```

## Asynchronous Programing

Many functions in JavaScript are initiate now, but they finish later. Those are called asynchronous functions.

A function that does something asynchronously can provide a callback argument function to run after it’s complete. Callbacks will run right after the task has completed.

## Example

Take a look at the function `loadScript(src)`, that loads a script with the given src:

```js
function loadScript(src) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;
  document.head.append(script);
}

loadScript('/my/script.js');
// the code below loadScript
// doesn't wait for the script loading to finish
```

The script is executed *“asynchronously”*, as it starts loading now, but runs later, when the function has already finished. If there’s any code below `loadScript(…)`, it doesn’t wait until the script loading finishes.

```js
loadScript('/my/script.js'); // the script has "function newFunction() {…}"
newFunction(); // no such function!
```

Naturally, the browser probably didn’t have time to load the script. As of now, the `loadScript` function doesn’t provide a way to track the load completion.

Solution:

```js
function loadScript(src, callback) {
  let script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = src;

  script.onload = () => callback(script);

  document.head.append(script);
}

// Now if we want to call new functions from the script, we should write that in the callback:
loadScript('/my/script.js', function() {
  // the callback runs after the script is loaded
  newFunction(); // so now it works
  ...
});
```

That’s the idea: the second argument is a function (usually anonymous) that runs when the action is completed.
