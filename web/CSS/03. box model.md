# The box model

CSS layout is based principally on the box model: every element in web design is a rectangular box. Each of the blocks taking up space on your page has properties like this:

- **Padding**: the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text)
- **Border**: the solid line that sits just outside the padding
- **Margin**: the space around the outside of the element

If `padding` or `borders` are undeclared, they are either zero (likely if you are using a css reset) or the browser default value (probably not zero especially on form elements that are commonly not reset).

If the `width` of a box is undeclared (and the box is a block level element), things get a little weirder. Letâ€™s start with that, and then move on to some other good-to-know stuff about the box model.


## box sizing

The `box-sizing` CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

By default in the CSS box model, the width and height you assign to an element is applied only to the element's content box. If the element has any border or padding, this is then added to the width and height to arrive at the size of the box that's rendered on the screen. This means that when you set width and height, you have to adjust the value you give to allow for any border or padding that may be added.

The **box-sizing** property can be used to adjust this behavior:

- `content-box` gives you the default CSS box-sizing behavior. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, then the element's content box will be 100 pixels wide, and the width of any border or padding will be **added** to the final rendered width, making the element wider than 100px.
- `border-box` tells the browser to account for any border and padding in the values you specify for an element's width and height. If you set an element's width to 100 pixels, that 100 pixels will include any border or padding you added, and the content box will **shrink** to absorb that extra width. This typically makes it much easier to size elements.
