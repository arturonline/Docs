# The box model

CSS layout is based principally on the box model: every element in web design is a rectangular box. Each of the blocks taking up space on your page has properties like this:

- **Padding**: the space just around the content (e.g., around paragraph text)
- **Border**: the solid line that sits just outside the padding
- **Margin**: the space around the outside of the element

If `padding` or `borders` are undeclared, they are either zero (likely if you are using a css reset) or the browser default value (probably not zero especially on form elements that are commonly not reset).

If the `width` of a box is undeclared (and the box is a block level element), things get a little weirder. Letâ€™s start with that, and then move on to some other good-to-know stuff about the box model.
