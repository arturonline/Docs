# CSS Syntax

At its most basic level, CSS consists of two building blocks:

- Properties: Human-readable identifiers that indicate which stylistic features (e.g. font, width, background color) you want to change.
- Values: Each specified property is given a value, which indicates how you want to change those stylistic features (e.g. what you want to change the font, width or background color to.)

A property paired with a value is called a CSS declaration. CSS declarations are put within CSS Declaration Blocks. And finally, CSS declaration blocks are paired with selectors to produce CSS Rulesets (or CSS Rules).

## CSS declaration

The property and value in each pair is separated by a colon (:).

## CSS Blocks

Declarations are grouped in blocks wrapped by curly braces `{}`.
Each declaration contained inside a declaration block has to be separated by a semi-colon `;`.

## CSS Comments

Comments in CSS begin with `/*` and end with `*/`.

## Shorthand

Some properties like font, background, padding, border, and margin are called shorthand properties â€” this is because they allow you to set several property values in a single line, saving time and making your code neater in the process.

Example:

```css
padding: 10px 15px 15px 5px;
```

Does the same thing as all these:

```css
padding-top: 10px;
padding-right: 15px;
padding-bottom: 15px;
padding-left: 5px;
```
