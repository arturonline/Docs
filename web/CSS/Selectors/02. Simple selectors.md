# Simple Selectors

Simple selectors directly match one or more elements of a document, based on the type of element, class, or id.

| Name         | selector    | selection                   |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| element      | p           | `<p>`                       |
| ID           | `#my-id`    | `<p id="my-id">`            |
| Class        | `.my-class` | `<p class="my-class">`      |  

## Element Selectors

This selector is just a case-insensitive match between the selector name and a given HTML element name.

Here is some HTML:

```html
<p>What color do you like?</p>
<div>I like blue.</div>
<p>I prefer BLACK!</p>
```

A simple style sheet:

```css
/* All p elements are red */
p {
  color: red;
}

/* All div elements are blue */
div {
  color: blue;
}
```

## Class Selectors

The class selector consists of a dot, '.', followed by a class name. A class name is any value, without spaces, placed within an HTML class attribute. It is up to you to choose a name for the class. It is also noteworthy that multiple elements in a document can have the same class value, and a single element can have multiple class names separated by white space.

```html
Here is some HTML:

<ul>
  <li class="first done">Create an HTML document</li>
  <li class="second done">Create a CSS style sheet</li>
  <li class="third">Link them all together</li>
</ul>
```

A simple style sheet that styles two of these classes:

```css
/* The element with the class "first" is bolded */
.first {
  font-weight: bold;
}

/* All the elements with the class "done" are strikethrough */
.done {
  text-decoration: line-through;
}
```

## ID Selectors

The ID selector consists of a hash/pound symbol (#), followed by the ID name of a given element. Any element can have a unique ID name set with the id attribute. It is up to you to choose an ID name. It's the most efficient way to select a single element.

>ðŸ’¡ Important: An ID name must be unique in the document. Behaviors regarding duplicated IDs are unpredictable.

```html
<p id="polite"> â€” "Good morning."</p>
<p id="rude"> â€” "Go away!"</p>
```

A simple style sheet:

```css
#polite {
  font-family: cursive;
}

#rude {
  font-family: monospace;
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```
