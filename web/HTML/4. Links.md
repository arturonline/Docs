# Links

A basic link is created by wrapping the text (or other content) you want to turn into a link inside an `<a>` element, and giving it an `href` attribute that will contain the web address you want the link to point to.

```html
<p>I'm creating a link to
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>

<p>I'm creating a link to
<a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/"
   title="The best place to find more information about Mozilla's
          mission and how to contribute">the Mozilla homepage</a>.
</p>
```

## URLs and Paths

- A `URL`, or Uniform Resource Locator is simply a string of text that defines where something is located on the Web.
- `URLs` use `paths` to find files. `Paths` specify where in the filesystem the file you are interested in is located.

Examples:

Same directory

```html
<a href="contacts.html">contacts page</a>
```

Moving down into subdirectories

```html
a href="projects/index.html">project homepage</a>
```

Moving back up into parent directories

```html
<a href="../pdfs/project-brief.pdf">project brief</a>
```

>ðŸ’¡ Note: You can combine multiple instances of these features into complex URLs, if needed, e.g.:<br><br>
`../../../complex/path/to/my/file.html.`

## Document Fragments

```html
<h2 id="Mailing_address">Mailing address</h2>

<!-- on the same document -->
<a href="#Mailing_address">company mailing address</a>
<!-- On another document -->
<a href="contacts.html#Mailing_address">mailing address</a>

```

## Absolute versus relative URLs

### Absolute URLs

absolute URL points to a location defined by its absolute location on the web, including protocol and domain name. `http://www.example.com`,

### Relative URLs

relative URLs points to a location that is relative to the file you are linking from. For example, if we wanted to link an example file at http://www.example.com/projects/index.html to a PDF file in the same directory, the URL would just be the filename â€” e.g. `project-brief.pdf` â€” no extra information needed.

If the PDF was available in a subdirectory inside projects called pdfs, the relative link would be `pdfs/project-brief.pdf`.

Of course, the location of the `project-brief.pdf` file and pdfs folder won't suddenly change because you moved the `index.html` file â€” this would make your link point to the wrong place, so it wouldn't work if clicked on.

## E-mail links

It is possible to create links or buttons that, when clicked, open a new outgoing email message rather than linking to a resource or page. This is done using the `<a>` element and the `mailto: URL scheme`.

```html
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org">Send email to nowhere</a>
```

Here's an example that includes a cc, bcc, subject and body:

```html
<a href="mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=name2@rapidtables.com&bcc=name3@rapidtables.com&subject=The%20subject%20of%20the%20email&body=The%20body%20of%20the%20email">
  Send mail with cc, bcc, subject and body
</a>
```

Here are a few other sample mailto URLs:

```html
mailto:

mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org

mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org,nobody@mozilla.org

mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org

mailto:nowhere@mozilla.org?cc=nobody@mozilla.org&subject=This%20is%20the%20subject
```
