## Accessibility: Figures

`<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements are created to provide a semantic container for figures, and clearly link the figure to the caption. The `<figcaption>` element tells browsers, and assistive technology that the caption describes the other content of the `<figure>` element.

```html
<figure>
  <img src="images/dinosaur.jpg"
       alt="The head and torso of a dinosaur skeleton;
            it has a large head with long sharp teeth"
       width="400"
       height="341">

  <figcaption>A T-Rex on display in the Manchester University Museum.</figcaption>
</figure>
```

>⚠ A figure doesn't have to be an image.

## CSS background images

```css
p {
  background-image: url("images/dinosaur.jpg");
}
```

The resulting embedded image, is arguably easier to position and control than `HTML images`. So why bother with `HTML images`? if an image has meaning, in terms of your content, you should use an `HTML` image. If an image is purely decoration, you should use `CSS background images`.

## Responsive images

> ⚡ [Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images)

To display identical image content depending on the device size we can use two new attributes — `srcset` and `sizes` — to provide several additional source images along with hints to help the browser pick the right one.

```html
<img srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg 320w,
             elva-fairy-480w.jpg 480w,
             elva-fairy-800w.jpg 800w"
     sizes="(max-width: 320px) 280px,
            (max-width: 480px) 440px,
            800px"
     src="elva-fairy-800w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">
```

- `srcset` defines the set of images we will allow the browser to choose between, and what size each image is.

- `sizes` defines a set of media conditions (e.g. screen widths) and indicates what image size would be best to choose, when certain media conditions are true — these are the hints we talked about earlier.

### Resolution switching

If you're supporting multiple display resolutions, you can allow the browser to choose an appropriate resolution image by using `srcset` with `x-descriptors`:

```html
<img srcset="elva-fairy-320w.jpg,
             elva-fairy-480w.jpg 1.5x,
             elva-fairy-640w.jpg 2x"
     src="elva-fairy-640w.jpg" alt="Elva dressed as a fairy">
```

In this example, the following `CSS` is applied to the image so that it will have a width of 320 pixels on the screen:

```css
img {
  width: 320px;
}
```

## The `<picture>` element

Like `<video>` and `<audio>`, The `<picture>` element is a wrapper containing several `<source>` elements that provide several different sources for the browser to choose between, followed by the all-important `<img>` element.

```html
<picture>
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="elva-480w-close-portrait.jpg">
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="elva-800w.jpg">
  <img src="elva-800w.jpg" alt="Chris standing up holding his daughter Elva">
</picture>
```

The `<source> elements` include a media attribute that contains a media condition — as with the first srcset example, these conditions are tests that decide which image is shown — the first one that returns **true** will be displayed. In this case, If the viewport width is *799px wide* or less, the first `<source> element's image` will be displayed. If the viewport width is *800px* or more, it'll be the second one.
