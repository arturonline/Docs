# HTML forms Overview

HTML Forms allow users to send data to the web site. An HTML Form is made of one or more widgets. Those widgets can be text fields (single line or multiline), select boxes, buttons, checkboxes, or radio buttons. Most of the time those widgets are paired with a label that describes their purpose.

All HTML forms start with a `<form>` element like this:

```html
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">

</form>
```

The `<form>` element defines how the data will be sent. All of its attributes are designed to let you configure the request to be sent when a user hits a submit button. The two most important attributes are **action** and **method**:

- The **action** attribute defines the location (URL) where the form's collected data should be sent when it is submitted.
- The **method** attribute defines which HTTP method to send the data with, "get" or "post".

## `<label>`, `<input>`,`<textarea>`

```html
<form action="/my-handling-form-page" method="post">
  <div>
    <label for="name">Name:</label>
    <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="mail">E-mail:</label>
    <input type="email" id="mail" name="user_mail">
  </div>
  <div>
    <label for="msg">Message:</label>
    <textarea id="msg" name="user_message"></textarea>
  </div>
</form>
```

The **id** attribute element has nothing to do with the data contained within the element. IDs are for hooking the element with JavaScript and CSS. The **name** attribute, however, is used in the HTTP request sent by your browser to the server as a variable name associated with the data contained in the value attribute. The **for** attribute is used to bound to an especific input field.

### The `<button>` element

```html
<div class="button">
  <button type="submit">Send your message</button>
</div>
```

the `<button>` element also accepts a type attribute â€” this accepts one of three values: `submit`, `reset`, or `button`.

- A click on a `submit` button (the default value) sends the form's data to the web page defined by the action attribute of the `<form>` element.
- A click on a `reset` button resets all the form widgets to their default value immediately. From a UX point of view, this is considered bad practice.
- A click on a `button` button does... nothing! That sounds silly, but it's amazingly useful for building custom buttons with JavaScript.
