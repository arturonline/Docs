Strings are value types (a Struct) that are copied when assigned or passed to a function. The copy is performed lazily on mutation.

```swift
var aString = "Hello"
var bString = aString
bString += " World!"    // "Hello World!"
print("\(aString)")     // "Hello\n"
```

## Initializing a String

```swift
var emptyString = ""            // Empty (Mutable) String
let stillEmpty = String()       // Another empty String
let helloWorld = "Hello World!" // String literal

let a = String(true)            // from boolean: "true"
let b: Character = "A"          // Explicit type to create a Character
let c = String(b)               // from character "A"
let d = String(3.14)            // from Double "3.14"
let e = String(1000)            // from Int "1000"
let f = "Result = \(d)"         // Interpolation "Result = 3.14"
let g = "\u{2126}"              // Unicode Ohm sign Ω

// New in Swift 4.2
let hex = String(254, radix: 16, uppercase: true) // "FE"
let octal = String(18, radix: 8) // "22"
```

### Creating a String With Repeating Values

```swift
let h = String(repeating:"01", count:3) // 010101
```

### Creating a String from a File

```swift
if let txtPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: "lorem", ofType: "txt") {
  do {
    let lorem = try String(contentsOfFile: txtPath, encoding: .utf8)
  } catch {
    print("Something went wrong")
  }
}
```

### Creating Multi-line String Literals(Swift 4)

Swift allows you to create a multi-line String literals. You wrap the strings in triple double quotes ("""String"""). You do not need to escape newlines and quotes within the string:

```swift
let verse = """
    To be, or not to be - that is the question;
    Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
    The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
    Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
    """
```

You can control the leading white space with the indentation of the text relative to the closing """. In the last example there is no leading whitespace in the final string literal. In this next example we indent the text by two spaces:

```swift
let indentedText = """
    Hello, this text is indented by
    two spaces from the closing quotes
  """
```

Source code with overly long string literals can be hard to read. To split long lines in the source use a \ to escape the new line.

```swift
let singleLongLine = """
    This is a single longe line split \
    over two lines by escaping the newline.
    """
```

### Creating Strings From Raw Text (Swift 5)

When creating strings from raw text you can customise the delimiter and escape characters. Using the default delimiter (double-quote) and escape sequence (backslash) to create a String you might write:

```swift
let title = "Insert \"title\" here"
// Insert "title" here
```

Swift 5 allows you to pad the delimiter and escape sequence with one or more #. We can write the previous example as follows:

```swift
let title2 = #"Insert "title" here"#
let title3 = ##"Insert "title" here"##
let title4 = ###"Insert "title" here"###
// Insert "title" here
```

Note that we don’t need to escape the double-quotes now as they are no longer a delimiter. If our raw text contains our chosen delimiter we can pad with an extra “#“:

```swift
// raw text is "#Hello#"
// start delimiter is ##"
// end delimiter is "##
let regex1 = ##""#Hello#""##       // "#Hello#"
```

If we pad the delimiters with one or more #’s, we also need to pad the backslash escape sequence. For example, when interpolating a value:

```swift
let name = "Tom"
let greeting1 = "Hello \(name)"    // Hello Tom
```

When padding with a single # the escape sequence becomes \#:

```swift
let greeting2 = #"Hello \#(name)"# // Hello Tom
```

Custom delimiters become useful when we want to preserve escaped raw text. For example, when creating a String from some JSON. Using a multi-line String literal seems like a good approach:

```swift
let json1 = """
{
  "colors": ["red","green","blue"],
  "label": "Insert \"title\" here"
}
"""
```

The multi-line string literal is convenient when the text contains quotes, but it introduces an error in this case. The problem is that the compiler strips the backslash escaping around “title” resulting in some invalid JSON:

```swift
{
   "colors": ["red","green","blue"],
   "label": "Insert "title" here"
}
```

If we use a custom delimiter with multi-line string literals we can keep the escape sequence in the raw text:

```swift
let json2 = #"""
{
  "colors": ["red","green","blue"],
  "label": "Insert \"title\" here"
}
"""#
```

The resulting String with the preserved raw text (note the backslash-escaped double-quotes aroung title):

```swift
{
   "colors": ["red","green","blue"],
   "label": "Insert \"title\" here"
}
```
