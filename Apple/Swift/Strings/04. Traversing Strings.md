# Traversing Strings

In Swift 4 strings are back to being collections of characters by default so iterating over a String or Substring gives you each character in the `String:

```swift
// Swift 4
for character in country {
    print(character)
}
```

In swift, you cannot randomly access an element in a string using a subscript (e.g. `string[5]`) but you cam use two instance properties to index into the collection:

* `startIndex`: the position of the first element if non-empty, else identical to endIndex.
* `endIndex`: the position just “past the end” of the string.

When used directly with a String or Substring you get an index into the character view:

```swift
let hello = "hello"
let startIndex = hello.startIndex // 0
let endIndex = hello.endIndex     // 5
hello[startIndex]                 // "h"
```

Note the choice for endIndex means you cannot use it directly as a subscript as it is out of range.

Use `index(after:)` and `index(before:)` to move forward or backward from an index:

```swift
hello[hello.index(after: startIndex)] // "e"
hello[hello.index(before: endIndex)]  // "o"
```

Use `index(_:offsetBy:)` to move in arbitrary steps. A negative offset moves backwards:

```swift
hello[hello.index(startIndex, offsetBy: 1)]  // "e"
hello[hello.index(endIndex, offsetBy: -4)]   // "e"
```

You can also limit the offset to avoid an error when you run off the end of the index. The function `index(_:offsetBy:limitedBy:)` returns an optional which will be nil if you go too far:

```swift
if let someIndex = hello.index(startIndex,
                   offsetBy: 4, limitedBy: endIndex) {
  hello[someIndex] // "o"
}
```

Using the utf16 view:

```swift
let cafe = "café"
let view = cafe.utf16
let utf16StartIndex = view.startIndex
let utf16EndIndex = view.endIndex

view[utf16StartIndex]                          // 99 - "c"
view[view.index(utf16StartIndex, offsetBy: 1)] // 97 - "a"
view[view.index(before: utf16EndIndex)]        // 233 - "é"
```

The indices property returns a range for all elements in a String that can be useful for iterating through the collection:

```swift
for index in cafe.indices {
  print(cafe[index])
}
```

You cannot use an index from one string to access a different string. You can convert an index to an integer value with the distance(from:to:) method:

```swift
let word1 = "ABCDEF"
let word2 = "012345"
if let indexC = word1.firstIndex(of: "C") {
  let distance = word1.distance(from: word1.startIndex, to: indexC) // 2
  let digit = word2[word2.index(startIndex, offsetBy: distance)]    // "2"
}
```

## First or last character

To get the first or last character in a String. The result is an optional returning nil if the String is empty.

```swift
country.first // "E"
country.last  // "a"
```

## Random Element and Shuffle

Swift 4.2 allows you to get a random element from any collection. When used on a String you get a random character or nil if the String is empty:

```swift
let suits = "♠︎♣︎♥︎♦︎"
suits.randomElement()
Iterate over shuffled String

for suit in suits.shuffled() {
  print(suit)
}
```

## Counting

Count is implemented for each of the collection views as it is dependent on the representation. The count property of a String is the character count.

```swift
// spain = España
spain.count                 // 6
spain.unicodeScalars.count  // 6
spain.utf16.count           // 6
spain.utf8.count            // 7
```
