# RXSwift: Operators

>[Docs](http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators.html)

Operators can be used in between the source Observable and the ultimate Subscriber to manipulate emitted elements. Using the operators we can modify, merge, filter or combine multiple observable sequences together.

Example:

Map applies the common operation (in the next example: `value * 10`) to all the incoming source observable elements and return the resulting Observable to the subscriber.

```swift
let disposeBag = DisposeBag()
let observable = Observable<Int>.of(1, 2, 3)
observable
.map { $0 * 10 }
.subscribe(onNext: { (value) in
    print("next: \(value)")
})
.disposed(by: disposeBag)
```

## Transforming Observables

Operators that transform items that are emitted by an Observable.

- **Buffer** — periodically gather items from an Observable into bundles and emit these bundles rather than emitting the items one at a time
- **FlatMap** — transform the items emitted by an Observable into Observables, then flatten the emissions from those into a single Observable
- **GroupBy** — divide an Observable into a set of Observables that each emit a different group of items from the original Observable, organized by key
- **Map** — transform the items emitted by an Observable by applying a function to each item
- **Scan** — apply a function to each item emitted by an Observable, sequentially, and emit each successive value
- **Window** — periodically subdivide items from an Observable into Observable windows and emit these windows rather than emitting the items one at a time

## Filtering Observables

Operators that selectively emit items from a source Observable.

- **Debounce** — only emit an item from an Observable if a particular timespan has passed without it emitting another item
- **Distinct** — suppress duplicate items emitted by an Observable
- **ElementAt** — emit only item n emitted by an Observable
- **Filter** — emit only those items from an Observable that pass a predicate test
- **First** — emit only the first item, or the first item that meets a condition, from an Observable
- **IgnoreElements** — do not emit any items from an Observable but mirror its termination notification
- **Last** — emit only the last item emitted by an Observable
- **Sample** — emit the most recent item emitted by an Observable within periodic time intervals
- **Skip** — suppress the first n items emitted by an Observable
- **SkipLast** — suppress the last n items emitted by an Observable
- **Take** — emit only the first n items emitted by an Observable
- **TakeLast** — emit only the last n items emitted by an Observable

## Combining Observables

Operators that work with multiple source Observables to create a single Observable

- **And/Then/When** — combine sets of items emitted by two or more Observables by means of Pattern and Plan intermediaries
- **CombineLatest** — when an item is emitted by either of two Observables, combine the latest item emitted by each Observable via a specified function and emit items based on the results of this function
- **Join** — combine items emitted by two Observables whenever an item from one Observable is emitted during a time window defined according to an item emitted by the other Observable
- **Merge** — combine multiple Observables into one by merging their emissions
- **StartWith** — emit a specified sequence of items before beginning to emit the items from the source Observable
- **Switch** — convert an Observable that emits Observables into a single Observable that emits the items emitted by the most-recently-emitted of those Observables
- **Zip** — combine the emissions of multiple Observables together via a specified function and emit single items for each combination based on the results of this function

## Conditional and Boolean Operators

Operators that evaluate one or more Observables or items emitted by Observables

- **All** — determine whether all items emitted by an Observable meet some criteria
- **Amb** — given two or more source Observables, emit all of the items from only the first of these Observables to emit an item
- **Contains** — determine whether an Observable emits a particular item or not
- **DefaultIfEmpty** — emit items from the source Observable, or a default item if the source Observable emits nothing
- **SequenceEqual** — determine whether two Observables emit the same sequence of items
- **SkipUntil** — discard items emitted by an Observable until a second Observable emits an item
- **SkipWhile** — discard items emitted by an Observable until a specified condition becomes false
- **TakeUntil** — discard items emitted by an Observable after a second Observable emits an item or terminates
- **TakeWhile** — discard items emitted by an Observable after a specified condition becomes false

## Mathematical and Aggregate Operators

Operators that operate on the entire sequence of items emitted by an Observable

- **Average** — calculates the average of numbers emitted by an Observable and emits this average
- **Concat** — emit the emissions from two or more Observables without interleaving them
- **Count** — count the number of items emitted by the source Observable and emit only this value
- **Max** — determine, and emit, the maximum-valued item emitted by an Observable
- **Min** — determine, and emit, the minimum-valued item emitted by an Observable
- **Reduce** — apply a function to each item emitted by an Observable, sequentially, and emit the final value
- **Sum** — calculate the sum of numbers emitted by an Observable and emit this sum
