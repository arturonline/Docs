# Enums

A Swift enum can either have raw values or associated values.

```swift
enum Airport {
    case munich
    case sanFrancisco
    case singapore
}
```

## Raw Values

Traditionally, each enum case was only a label for an Integer value. These labels were only necessary to make the code readable for humans while the computer itself was internally working with those Integers.

In swift, youâ€™re not bound to use Integers for the value that is represented by a particular case. You can use Strings, Characters or even Floats instead.

```Swift
enum Airport: String {
    case munich = "MUC"
    case sanFrancisco = "SFO"
    case singapore = "SIN"
}
```

Whatever the type you choose, the value you assign to a case is called a rawValue.

## Associated Values

Swift allows you to bind one (or several) additional values to an enum case. These values are called associated values.

```Swift
enum Airport {
    case munich
    case sanFrancisco
    case singapore
    case london(airportName: LondonAirportName)
}

enum LondonAirportName {
    case stansted
    case heathrow
    case gatwick
}

var airport: Airport

airport = .london(.heathrow)
```

## Working with enums

```Swift
enum Airport: String {
    case munich = "MUC"
    case sanFrancisco = "SFO"
    case singapore = "SIN"
}

let airport = .sanFrancisco
let airportRawValue = airport.rawValue // "SFO"
```

```Swift
enum Airport {
    case munich
    case sanFrancisco
    case singapore
    case london(airportName: LondonAirportName)

    var cityIdentifier: String {
        switch self {
        case .munich:
            return "MUC"
        case .sanFrancisco:
            return "SFO"
        case .singapore:
            return "SIN"
        case .london:
            return "LON"
        }
    }
}
```

## Enum Extensions

```Swift
enum AppColor:String {
    case AppClearColor
    case AppGrayColor
    case AppWhiteColor
    case PrimaryColor
    case PrimaryColor1
    case PrimaryColor2
    case PrimaryColor3
    case SecondaryColor1
    case ThemeColor
}

extension AppColor {
    var color: UIColor {
        get {
            return UIColor(named: self.rawValue)!
        }
    }
}

self.view.backgroundColor = AppColor.PrimaryColor.color
```

or if you want to add a property to all enums whose raw value is a string:

```Swift
extension RawRepresentable where RawValue == String {
    var description: String {
        return rawValue
    }
}
```
