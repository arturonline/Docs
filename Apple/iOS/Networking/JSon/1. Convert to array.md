# Convert Data from Json - same key names

When the JSON you use contains a homogeneous array of elements, you add a conformance to the Codable protocol on the individual element's type. To decode or encode the entire array, you use the syntax [Element].self.

In the example below, the GroceryProduct structure is automatically decodable because the GroceryProduct properties have the same name as the keys in the json file.

```Swift
import Foundation

let json = """
[
    {
        "name": "Banana",
        "points": 200,
        "description": "A banana grown in Ecuador."
    },
    {
        "name": "Orange",
        "points": 100
    }
]
""".data(using: .utf8)!

struct GroceryProduct: Codable {
    var name: String
    var points: Int
    var description: String?
}

let decoder = JSONDecoder()
let products = try decoder.decode([GroceryProduct].self, from: json)

print("The following products are available:")
for product in products {
    print("\t\(product.name) (\(product.points) points)")
    if let description = product.description {
        print("\t\t\(description)")
    }
}
```
