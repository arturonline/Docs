# View Controllers

A view controller's job is to manage a single screen or a portion of a screen in your app.

A view controllerâ€™s main responsibilities include the following:

- Updating the contents of the views, usually in response to changes to the underlying data.
- Responding to user interactions with views.
- Resizing views and managing the layout of the overall interface.
- Coordinating with other objects including other view controllers in your app.
