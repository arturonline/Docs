# Segues

A segue defines a transition and the presentation method from one view controller to another.

Each segue has:

1. A `Style`: how the view controller weill be presented.
2. An `Action`: The view object that triggers the segue.
3. An `Identifier`: To programatically access the segue

Whenever a segue gets triggered, it provides a place for you to add your own code that gets executed. This method is called `prepare(for:sender:)`, and it gives you a chance to store data and do any necessary cleanup on the view controller that the segue is coming from.

```Swift
override func prepare(for segue: UIStoryboardSegue, sender: Any?) {
    super.prepare(for: segue, sender: sender)
    }

// TODO
```

## Unwind Segue

Use unwind segues to implement navigation back to an existing view controller. If you want, for example, go back from VC3 to VC1:

### Step #1

In the view controller you are trying to go back to, (*VC1*) write this code:

```swift
    @IBAction func unwindToVC1(segue:UIStoryboardSegue) { }
```

### Step #2

In the Storyboard, go to the screen youâ€™re trying to unwind from (*VC3*), and control + drag the **view controller** icon to the **Exit icon** located on top.

### Step #3

Select the Unwind segue in the document outline, and then go to the Attributes Inspector and name the identifier of the unwind segue (ex: *unwindtoVC1*)

### Step #4

Finally, write this code where you want the unwind segue action to be triggered, V3 in our case.

```swift
@IBAction func goBackToOneButtonTapped(_ sender: Any) {
    performSegue(withIdentifier: "unwindSegueToVC1", sender: self)
}
```
