# Perform Segue

A segue defines a transition and the presentation method from one view controller to another.

```swift
performSegue(withIdentifier: "gotoSecondVC", sender self)
```

* **sender**: The object that you want to use to initiate the segue. This parameter makes the object available to your implementation during the segue.
* **Identifier**: In Interface Builder, you can provide an string identifier to a `segue` using the inspector. Pass this string to this parameter.

## Sending data back

Executing a segue is creating every time a NEW instance of the destination `ViewController` by the `UIStoryboardSegue`.

[Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uistoryboardsegue ) says:

>When the storyboard runtime detects a custom segue, it creates a new instance of your class, configures it with the view controller objects, asks the view controller source to prepare for the segue, and then performs the segue.

So the destination UIViewController is instantiated by the segue just before sending `prepareForSegue` to the source UIViewController. By the time your `prepareForSegue` is called, it is already instantiated - immediately beforehand.

This can be a problem when you try to send data back to a ViewController that is already created because `performSegue` will create a new instance.

To avoid this, when sending data back, use [delegates](iOS/Views/Segues/4. Send data back.md).
