# Perform Segue

A segue defines a transition and the presentation method from one view controller to another.

```swift
performSegue(withIdentifier: "gotoSecondVC", sender self)
```

* **sender**: The object that you want to use to initiate the segue. This parameter makes the object available to your implementation during the segue.
* **Identifier**: In Interface Builder, you can provide an string identifier to a `segue` using the inspector. Pass this string to this parameter.

## Sending data back

Executing a segue is creating every time a NEW instance of the destination `ViewController` by the `UIStoryboardSegue`.

This can be a problem when you try to send data back to a ViewController that is already created because `performSegue` will create a new instance.

To avoid this, when sending data back, use [delegates](4.%20send%20data%20back.md).
