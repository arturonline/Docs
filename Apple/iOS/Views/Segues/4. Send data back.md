# Send data Back

Executing a segue is creating every time a NEW instance of the destination `ViewController` by the `UIStoryboardSegue`.

[Apple's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uistoryboardsegue ) says:

>When the storyboard runtime detects a custom segue, it creates a new instance of your class, configures it with the view controller objects, asks the view controller source to prepare for the segue, and then performs the segue.

So the destination UIViewController is instantiated by the segue just before sending `prepareForSegue` to the source UIViewController. By the time your `prepareForSegue` is called, it is already instantiated - immediately beforehand.

This can be a problem when you try to send data back to a ViewController that is already created because `performSegue` will create a new instance.

To avoid this, use delegates.
