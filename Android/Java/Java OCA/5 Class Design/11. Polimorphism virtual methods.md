# Polimorphism Virtual Methods

 A virtual method is a method in which the specific implementation is not determined until runtime.

```Java
public class Bird {
    public String getName() {
        return "Unknown";
    }
    public void displayInformation() {
        System.out.println("The bird name is: "+ getName());
    }
}
public class Peacock extends Bird {
    public String getName() {
        return "Peacock";
    }
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bird bird = new Peacock();
        bird.displayInformation();
    }
}
// The bird name is: Peacock
```

Even though the parent class Bird defines its own version of getName() and doesnâ€™t know anything about the Peacock class during compile-time, at runtime the instance uses the overridden version of the method, as defined on the instance of the object.
