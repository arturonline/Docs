# Assignment Operator

An assignment operator is a binary operator that modifies, or assigns, the variable on the left-hand side of the operator, with the result of the value on the right-hand side of the equation.

eg1:

```Java
int x = 1.0; // DOES NOT COMPILE
short y = 1921222; // DOES NOT COMPILE
int z = 9f; // DOES NOT COMPILE
long t = 192301398193810323; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

eg2:

```Java
long x = 5;
long y = (x=3);
System.out.println(x); // Outputs 3
System.out.println(y); // Also, outputs 3
```
