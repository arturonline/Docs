# Unary Operator

A unary operator is one that requires exactly one operand, or variable, to function.

```Java
int x = !5; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean y = -true; // DOES NOT COMPILE
boolean z = !0; // DOES NOT COMPILE
```

## Increment and Decrement Operators

* **++a** increments and then uses the variable.
* **a++** uses and then increments the variable.

If the operator is placed before the operand then the operator is applied first and the value return is the new value of the expression.

Alternatively, if the operator is placed after the operand then the original value of the expression is returned, with operator applied after the value is returned.

Eg.1:

```java
int counter = 0;
System.out.println(counter); // Outputs 0
System.out.println(++counter); // Outputs 1
System.out.println(counter); // Outputs 1
System.out.println(counter--); // Outputs 1
System.out.println(counter); // Outputs 0`
```

Eg.2:

```Java
int x = 3;
int y = ++x * 5 / x-- + --x;
System.out.println("x is " + x);
System.out.println("y is " + y);
```

* First, the x is incremented and returned to the expression, which is multiplied by 5. We can simplify this:

```Java
int y = 4 * 5 / x-- + --x; // x assigned value of 4
```

* Next, x is decremented, but the original value of 4 is used in the expression, leading to this:

```Java
int y = 4 * 5 / 4 + --x; // x assigned value of 3
```

* The final assignment of x reduces the value to 2, and since this is a pre-increment operator, that value is returned to the expression:

```Java
int y = 4 * 5 / 4 + 2; // x assigned value of 2
```

* Finally, we evaluate the multiple and division from left-to-right, and finish with the addition. The result is then printed:

```Java
x is 2
y is 7
```
