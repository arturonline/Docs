# Dispose with the using statement

When you finish using an object that implements `IDisposable`, you should call the object's `IDisposable.Dispose` implementation. You can do this in one of two ways:

1. With the C# `using statement`.
2. By implementing a `try/finally block`.

## The using Statement

The `using` statement in C# simplify the code that you must write to create and clean up an object. The using statement obtains one or more resources, executes the statements that you specify, and automatically disposes of the object. However, the using statement is useful only for objects that are used within the scope of the method in which they are constructed.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Char[] buffer = new Char[50];
      using (StreamReader s = new StreamReader("File1.txt")) {
         int charsRead = 0;
         while (s.Peek() != -1) {
            charsRead = s.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
            //
            // Process characters read.
            //
         }
         s.Close();
      }

   }
}
```

Note that although the StreamReader class implements the `IDisposable` interface, which indicates that it uses an unmanaged resource, the example doesn't explicitly call the `StreamReader.Dispose` method.

When the C# compiler encounters the using statement, it emits intermediate language (IL) that is equivalent to the following code that explicitly contains a `try/finally` block:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Char[] buffer = new Char[50];
      {
         StreamReader s = new StreamReader("File1.txt"); 
         try {
            int charsRead = 0;
            while (s.Peek() != -1) {
               charsRead = s.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
               //
               // Process characters read.
               //
            }
            s.Close();
         }
         finally {
            if (s != null)
               ((IDisposable)s).Dispose();
         }
      }
   }
}
```

The C# using statement also allows you to acquire multiple resources in a single statement, which is internally equivalent to nested using statements. The following example instantiates two StreamReader objects to read the contents of two different files:

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Char[] buffer1 = new Char[50], buffer2 = new Char[50];

      using (StreamReader version1 = new StreamReader("file1.txt"),
                          version2 = new StreamReader("file2.txt")) {
         int charsRead1, charsRead2 = 0;
         while (version1.Peek() != -1 && version2.Peek() != -1) {
            charsRead1 = version1.Read(buffer1, 0, buffer1.Length);
            charsRead2 = version2.Read(buffer2, 0, buffer2.Length);
            //
            // Process characters read.
            //
         }
         version1.Close();
         version2.Close();
      }
   }
}
```

After disposing an item, you can’t use it any more. Using a disposed item will result in an `ObjectDisposedException`.

## Try/finally block

Instead of wrapping a `try/finally` block in a `using` statement, you may choose to implement the `try/finally` block directly. This may be your personal coding style, or you might want to do this for one of the following reasons:

1. To include a `catch` block to handle any exceptions thrown in the `try` block. Otherwise, any exceptions thrown by the using statement are unhandled, as are any exceptions thrown within the using block if a `try/catch` block isn't present.
1. To instantiate an object that implements `IDisposable` whose scope is not local to the block within which it is declared.

The following example is similar to the previous example, except that it uses a `try/catch/finally` block to instantiate, use, and dispose of a `StreamReader` object, and to handle any exceptions thrown by the `StreamReader` constructor and its `ReadToEnd` method. Note that the code in the finally block checks that the object that implements `IDisposable` isn't null before it calls the Dispose method. Failure to do this can result in a `NullReferenceException` exception at run time.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using System.IO;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      StreamReader sr = null;
      try {
         sr = new StreamReader("file1.txt");
         String contents = sr.ReadToEnd();
         sr.Close();
         Console.WriteLine("The file has {0} text elements.",
                           new StringInfo(contents).LengthInTextElements);
      }
      catch (FileNotFoundException) {
         Console.WriteLine("The file cannot be found.");
      }
      catch (IOException) {
         Console.WriteLine("An I/O error has occurred.");
      }
      catch (OutOfMemoryException) {
         Console.WriteLine("There is insufficient memory to read the file.");
      }
      finally {
         if (sr != null) sr.Dispose();
      }
   }
}
```

If you also want to use a catch statement when working with an `IDisposable` object, you need to do this manually by writing a `try/catch/finally` statement where you call Dispose in the finally clause.

It’s important to know the difference between implementing `IDisposable` and a `finalizer`. Both clean up your object, but a finalizer is called by the garbage collector, and the Dispose method can be called from code.
