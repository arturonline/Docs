# Generations

GC supports the concept of generations. It helps to organize short-lived and long-lived objects in a managed heap. There are three generations:

## Generation 0

When an object is allocated on heap, it belongs to generation 0. It is the young generation, which contains short-lived objects like temporary variables. If newly allocated objects are larger in size, they will go on the large object heap in a generation 2 collection. GC occurs mostly in generation 0.

## Generation 1

When objects survive from a garbage collection of generation 0, they go to generation 1. Objects in generation 1 serve as a buffer between short-lived and long-lived objects.

## Generation 2

When objects survive from a garbage collection of generation 1, they go to generation 2. Objects in generation 2 serve as long-lived objects. If objects still survived in generation 2, they remain in generation 2 till they're alive.

## Steps Involved in Garbage Collection

1. Suspend all managed threads except for the thread that triggered the garbage collection.
2. Find a list of all live objects.
3. Remove dead objects and reclaim their memory.
4. Compact the survived objects and promote them to an older generation.
