# Types and Memory Management

[Memory management by MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/memory-management-and-gc)

In a .NET framework, CLR manages instances of value and reference type on three memory locations:

1. Heap
2. Stack
3. Registers

## 1. Heap

It’s a memory location where instances of reference type are stored.

Instances of value type can also be stored on heap when:

* value type is part of a class;
* value type is boxed;
* value type is an array;
* value type is a static variable;
* value type is used in an async or iterator block;
* value type is closed-over locals of a lambda or anonymous method.

Heap is an ideal location for instances that have a longer lifetime.

## Stack

It’s a memory location where short-lived temporary instances of value type and the memory address of an object can be stored.

Temporary short-lived variables that Stack can store are:

* value types that are declared inside a method body or inside a parameter list;
* the memory address of an instance of a reference type.
* It uses LIFO (Last In First Out) algorithm to manage the lifetime of each variable in a Stack.

## Register

It’s a memory location where instances of short-lived temporary instances of value type or computation values of arithmetic operations are stored on register. Its memory size is relatively much smaller than Stack. Its up to CLR, which decides which short-lived memory instances are stored on either Stack or on Register.
