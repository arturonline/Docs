# `ConcurrentDictionary<k, v>`

A ConcurrentDictionary stores key and value pairs in a thread-safe manner. You can use methods to add and remove items, and to update items in place if they exist.

When working with a `ConcurrentDictionary` you have methods that can `atomically` *add*, *get*, and *update* items, as a single step without other threads interfering.

- `TryUpdate` checks to see whether the current value is equal to the existing value before updating it.
- `AddOrUpdate` makes sure an item is added if it’s not there, and updated to a new value if it is.
- `GetOrAdd` gets the current value of an item if it’s available; if not, it adds the new value by using a factory method.

Example 1:

```csharp
class CD_Ctor
{
        // Demonstrates:
        //      ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue> ctor(concurrencyLevel, initialCapacity)
        //      ConcurrentDictionary<TKey, TValue>[TKey]
        static void Main()
        {
            // We know how many items we want to insert into the ConcurrentDictionary.
            // So set the initial capacity to some prime number above that, to ensure that
            // the ConcurrentDictionary does not need to be resized while initializing it.
            int NUMITEMS = 64;
            int initialCapacity = 101;

            // The higher the concurrencyLevel, the higher the theoretical number of operations
            // that could be performed concurrently on the ConcurrentDictionary.  However, global
            // operations like resizing the dictionary take longer as the concurrencyLevel rises. 
            // For the purposes of this example, we'll compromise at numCores * 2.
            int numProcs = Environment.ProcessorCount;
            int concurrencyLevel = numProcs * 2;

            // Construct the dictionary with the desired concurrencyLevel and initialCapacity
            ConcurrentDictionary<int, int> cd = new ConcurrentDictionary<int, int>(concurrencyLevel, initialCapacity);

            // Initialize the dictionary
            for (int i = 0; i < NUMITEMS; i++) cd[i] = i * i;

            Console.WriteLine("The square of 23 is {0} (should be {1})", cd[23], 23 * 23);
        }
}
```

Example 2:

```csharp
var dict = new ConcurrentDictionary<string, int>();

if (dict.TryAdd("k1", 42))
{
    Console.WriteLine("Added");
}

if (dict.TryUpdate("k1", 21, 42))
{
    Console.WriteLine("42 updated to 21");
}

dict["k1"] = 42; // Overwrite unconditionally

int r1 = dict.AddOrUpdate("k1", 3, (s, i) => i * 2);
int r2 = dict.GetOrAdd("k2", 3);
```
