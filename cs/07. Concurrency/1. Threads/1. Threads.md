# Asynchronous processing

C# supports parallel execution of code through multithreading. A thread is an independent execution path, able to run simultaneously with other threads.

A C# client program (Console, WPF, UWP or Windows Forms) starts in a single thread created automatically by the *CLR* and operating system (the *“main”* thread), and is made multithreaded by creating additional threads.

A thread can be created by using `System.Threading.Thread` class and can only be manipulated on a method.

Here’s a simple example and its output:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class ThreadTest
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Thread t = new Thread (WriteY);          // Kick off a new thread
    t.Start();                               // running WriteY()

    // Simultaneously, do something on the main thread.
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) Console.Write ("x");
  }

  static void WriteY()
  {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) Console.Write ("y");
  }
}

// xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
// xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyy
```

The main thread creates a new `thread t` on which it runs a method that repeatedly prints the character `“y”`. Simultaneously, the main thread repeatedly prints the character `“x”`

Once started, a thread’s `IsAlive` property returns true, until the point where the thread ends. A thread ends when the delegate passed to the Thread’s constructor finishes executing. Once ended, a thread cannot restart.

## Creating and Starting Threads

Threads are created using the `Thread class’s constructor`, passing in a `ThreadStart delegate`:

```csharp
public delegate void ThreadStart();
public delegate void ParameterizedThreadStart (object obj);
```

The delegate wraps the method that is invoked by the new thread when you call the `Start()` method which indicates where execution should begin.

Syntax:

```csharp
Thread t = new Thread(voidMethod); // ThreadStart delegate infered
Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(voidMethod));
Thread t = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(Object voidMethod));

t.start()
```

Another shortcut is to use a lambda expression or anonymous method:

```csharp
Thread t = new Thread ( () => Console.WriteLine ("Hello!") );

t.start()
```

### Example

Here’s an example, using the expanded C# syntax for creating a TheadStart delegate:

```csharp
class ThreadTest
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Thread t = new Thread (new ThreadStart (Go));

    t.Start();   // Run Go() on the new thread.
    Go();        // Simultaneously run Go() in the main thread.
  }

  static void Go()
  {
    Console.WriteLine ("hello!");
  }
}
```

In this example, `thread t` executes `Go()` at the same time the main thread calls `Go()`. The result is two near-instant hellos.

## Passing Data to a Thread

Several ways:

### With Lambda Expression

The easiest way to pass arguments to a thread’s target method is to execute a lambda expression that calls the method with the desired arguments:

```csharp
static void Main()
{
  Thread t = new Thread ( () => Print ("Hello from t!") );
  t.Start();
}

static void Print (string message) 
{
  Console.WriteLine (message);
}
```

With this approach, you can pass in any number of arguments to the method. You can even wrap the entire implementation in a multi-statement lambda:

```csharp
new Thread (() =>
{
  Console.WriteLine ("I'm running on another thread!");
  Console.WriteLine ("This is so easy!");
}).Start();
```

You can do the same thing almost as easily in C# 2.0 with anonymous methods:

### With Anonymous methods

```csharp
new Thread (delegate()
{
  ...
}).Start();
```

### With Thread's Start method

When a managed thread is created, the method that executes on the thread is represented by a `ThreadStart delegate` or a `ParameterizedThreadStart delegate` that is passed to the Thread constructor.

- A `ThreadStart delegate` -> can have any method that has no parameters and that returns void.
- A `ParameterizedThreadStart delegate` -> can have any method that has a single parameter of type Object and that returns void.

Thread’s constructor is overloaded to accept either of two delegates:

```csharp
static void Main()
{
  Thread t = new Thread (Print);
  t.Start ("Hello from t!");
}

static void Print (object messageObj)
{
  string message = (string) messageObj;   // We need to cast here
  Console.WriteLine (message);
}
```

The limitation of `ParameterizedThreadStart` is that it accepts only one argument. And because it’s of type `object`, it usually needs to be cast.

## Foreground and Background Threads

There are two kinds of threads in C#, i.e., `Foreground` thread and `Background` thread. By default, in C# all threads that are explicitly created are initialized as foreground thread. An application cannot terminate its execution until all its foreground threads are completed.

A `background` thread is almost identical to a foreground thread. The one difference is that, once all foreground threads finish (including main thread), the application ends, and any background threads still running abruptly terminate.

A thread can be changed to a `background` thread at any time by setting its `IsBackground` property to true.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace Chapter1
{
  public static class Program
  {
    public static void ThreadMethod()
    {
      for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
      {
        Console.WriteLine(“ThreadProc: {0}”, i);
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
      }
    }

    public static void Main()
    {
      Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(ThreadMethod));
      t.IsBackground = true;
      t.Start();
    }
  }
}
```

If you run this application with the `IsBackground` property set to true, the application exits immediately. If you set it to false (creating a foreground thread), the application prints the ThreadProc message ten times.

In this case, the value 5 is passed to the ThreadMethod as an object. You can cast it to the expected type to use it in your method.

## Thread Pooling

A **thread pool** is a collection of background threads created by a system and are available to perform any task when required. The cost of instantiating a managed thread is higher than reusing a free thread.

When a program requires an extra thread, it is more efficient to use available free threads from a thread pool because it can save the cost of creating a thread. And when a thread completes its execution, it can go back to the threadpool so other programs can reuse the same thread again.

.NET has implemented its own definition of thread pool through the `ThreadPool` class. It has a method, `QueueUserWorkItem`, which helps to queue the execution of available threads in a thread pool.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class Example
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Queue the task.
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(ThreadProc);
        Console.WriteLine("Main thread does some work, then sleeps.");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        Console.WriteLine("Main thread exits.");
    }

    // This thread procedure performs the task.
    static void ThreadProc(Object stateInfo)
    {
        // No state object was passed to QueueUserWorkItem, so stateInfo is null.
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from the thread pool.");
    }
}
// The example displays output like the following:
//       Main thread does some work, then sleeps.
//       Hello from the thread pool.
//       Main thread exits.
```

If you comment out the call to the Thread.Sleep method, the main thread exits before method runs on the thread pool thread. The thread pool uses background threads, which do not keep the application running if all foreground threads have terminated. (This is a simple example of a race condition.)

The threads in the managed thread pool are background threads. That is, their `IsBackground` properties are true. This means that a ThreadPool thread will not keep an application running after all foreground threads have exited.

### Limitation of Thread Pool

* You cannot set the name of a pooled thread.
* Pooled threads are always **background** threads.
* It is hard to tell when a thread of a threadpool has finished its execution.
* There is no `Start()` method, so we cannot tell when a thread of a thread pool has started its execution because it is being managed by the system.
* It can’t manage a thread which returns a value.
* A pooled thread's priority can be changed... it will be restored to normal when released back to the pool.

## Using ThreadLocal<T>

If you want to use local data in a thread, you can use the ThreadLocal<T> class. With `ThreadLocal<T>` you can create local variables of type `<T>` to use on thread.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class ThreadLocalDemo
{
        // Demonstrates:
        //      ThreadLocal(T) constructor
        //      ThreadLocal(T).Value
        //      One usage of ThreadLocal(T)
        static void Main()
        {
            // Thread-Local variable that yields a name for a thread
            ThreadLocal<string> ThreadName = new ThreadLocal<string>(() =>
            {
                return "Thread" + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId;
            });

            // Action that prints out ThreadName for the current thread
            Action action = () =>
            {
                // If ThreadName.IsValueCreated is true, it means that we are not the
                // first action to run on this thread.
                bool repeat = ThreadName.IsValueCreated;

                Console.WriteLine("ThreadName = {0} {1}", ThreadName.Value, repeat ? "(repeat)" : "");
            };

            // Launch eight of them.  On 4 cores or less, you should see some repeat ThreadNames
            Parallel.Invoke(action, action, action, action, action, action, action, action);

            // Dispose when you are done
            ThreadName.Dispose();
        }
}
```

## Using the ThreadStaticAttribute

By marking a field with the ThreadStatic attribute, each thread gets its own copy of a static field.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
  [ThreadStatic]
  static int _count = 0;

  static void Main()
  {
      Thread threadA = new Thread(() =>
      {
          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
          {
              Console.WriteLine("ThreadA _count = {0} ", _count++);
          }
      });

      Thread threadB = new Thread(() =>
      {
          for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
          {
              Console.WriteLine("ThreadB _count = {0} ", _count++);
          }
      });

      threadA.Start();
      threadB.Start();
  }
}
// Output:
// ThreadA _count = 0
// ThreadA _count = 1
// ThreadA _count = 2
// ThreadA _count = 3
// ThreadA _count = 4
// ThreadA _count = 5
// ThreadA _count = 6
// ThreadA _count = 7
// ThreadA _count = 8
// ThreadA _count = 9
// ThreadB _count = 0
// ThreadB _count = 1
// ThreadB _count = 2
// ThreadB _count = 3
// ThreadB _count = 4
// ThreadB _count = 5
// ThreadB _count = 6
// ThreadB _count = 7
// ThreadB _count = 8
// ThreadB _count = 9
```

With the `ThreadStaticAttribute` applied, the maximum value of _field becomes 10. If you remove it, you can see that both threads access the same value and it becomes 20.
