# Binary Serialization

The XmlSerializer outputs human-readable text. You can open it in Notepad, for example, to inspect and edit it. But the human readability of the file also adds to its size. By using a binary format, you get a smaller result. You can also serialize data that is not suitable for an XML format such as an image.

To perform this type of serialization, you just need to mark an item with the `Serializable` attribute. After that, you need to use the instance of `BinaryFormatter`  to serialize the object or object graph.

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Teacher
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public decimal Salary { get; set; }
}

//Created the Instance and initialized
Teacher teacher = new Teacher()
{
    ID = 1,
    Name = "Ijaz",
    Salary = 1000
};

//Binary Serializer
BinaryFormatter formatter = new BinaryFormatter();

//Sample.bin(Binary File is Created) to store binary serialized data
using (FileStream file = new FileStream("Sample.bin",FileMode.Create))
{
    //this function serialize the teacher object in the stream "file"
    formatter.Serialize(file,teacher);
}

Console.WriteLine("Binary Serialization is Successfully Done!");
```

```csharp
//Binary Deserialization
using (FileStream file = new FileStream("Sample.bin",FileMode.Open))
{
    Teacher dteacher=(Teacher)formatter.Deserialize(file);
}

Console.WriteLine("Binary Deserialization is Successfully Done!");
```

In binary serialization, all the fields can be serialized, even those that are private. You can prevent fields from being serialized by using a `NonSerialized` attribute. For example, you don’t want to serialize the field Salary of Teacher. You can do this:

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Teacher
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    [NonSerialized]
    public decimal Salary;
}
```

Binary serialization is stricter than other serializations. When the Binary Serializer can’t find a specific field, it throws an exception. You can use `OptionalFieldAttribute` to make sure that the binary serializer knows that the field is added in later versions and the current serialized object will not contain this field.
