# Manipulate strings

- A string in C# is an object of type String whose value is text.
- The string object contains an array of `Char` objects internally. A string has a `Length` property that shows the number of Char objects it contains.
- In C#, you can refer to a string both as String and string. The string keyword is just an alias for the .NET Frameworkâ€™s String.
- String is a reference type that looks like value type (for example, the equality operators == and != are overloaded to compare on value, not on reference).
- One of the special characteristics of a String is that it is **immutable**, so it cannot be changed after it has been created. Every change to a String will create a new String. This is why all of the String manipulation methods return a String.

## Example

```csharp
// Declare without initializing.
string message1;

// Initialize to null.
string message2 = null;

// Initialize as an empty string.
// Use the Empty constant instead of the literal "".
string message3 = System.String.Empty;

//Initialize with a regular string literal.
string oldPath = "c:\\Program Files\\Microsoft Visual Studio 8.0";

// Initialize with a verbatim string literal.
string newPath = @"c:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0";

// Use System.String if you prefer.
System.String greeting = "Hello World!";

// In local variables (i.e. within a method body)
// you can use implicit typing.
var temp = "I'm still a strongly-typed System.String!";

// Use a const string to prevent 'message4' from
// being used to store another string value.
const string message4 = "You can't get rid of me!";

// Use the String constructor only when creating
// a string from a char*, char[], or sbyte*. See
// System.String documentation for details.
char[] letters = { 'A', 'B', 'C' };
string alphabet = new string(letters);
```

## Manipulating strings

Because of the immutability of Strings, the .NET Framework offers several classes that can be used when building Strings.

### StringBuilder

`StringBuilder` uses a string buffer internally to improve performance.

Good for:

- `StringBuilder` does always give better performance when you are working with an arbitrary number of strings.

Bad for:

- When concatenating a fixed series of strings, the compiler can optimize this and combine individual concatenation operations into a single operation which is better than using `stringbuilder`.

### StringReader & StringWriter

#### StringReader

`StringReader` enables you to read a string `synchronously` or `asynchronously`. You can read a character at a time with the `Read` or the `ReadAsync` method, a line at a time using the `ReadLine` or the `ReadLineAsync` method and an entire string using the `ReadToEnd` or the `ReadToEndAsync` method.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    //'@' It's a verbatim string literal. It ignores escape sequence
    string text = @"Hi I'm Ali Asad.
    I can help you in C# Certification Exam.
    I've helped many individuals like you in their exam prep.
    I believe if we work together, you can become:
    Microsoft Certified Professional & Specialist in C#";

    StringReader reader = new StringReader(text);
    int currentLine = 0;
    string line = "";

    //return each line of string to 'line'
    while((line = reader.ReadLine())!= null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("line{0}: {1}", ++currentLine, line);
    }

}
// Output:
// Line1: Hi I'm Ali Asad.
// Line2: I can help you in C# Certification Exam.
// Line3: I've helped many individuals like you in their exam prep.
// Line4: I believe if we work together, you can become:
// Line5: Microsoft Certified Professional & Specialist in C#
```

#### StringWriter

`StringWriter` enables you to write to a string `synchronously` or `asynchronously`. You can write a character at a time with the `Write(Char)` or the `WriteAsync(Char)` method, a string at a time using the `Write(String)` or the `WriteAsync(String)` method. In addition, you can write a character, an array of characters or a string followed by the line terminator asynchronously with one of the `WriteLineAsync` methods.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Text;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        StringBuilder builder = new StringBuilder();
        StringWriter swriter = new StringWriter(builder);
        swriter.Write("Ali Asad");

        Console.WriteLine(builder.ToString());
    }
}
// Output:
// Ali Asad
```
