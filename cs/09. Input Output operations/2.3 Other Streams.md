# Other Streams

## Memory Stream

MemoryStream creates a stream whose backing store is memory.

```csharp
// Use of MemoryStream

MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
string content = "This is file content";
byte[] contentInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

//Write into file
memoryStream.Write(contentInBytes, 0, contentInBytes.Length);

//Set the position to the begninig of stream
memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

//Read from file
byte[] readContent = new byte[memoryStream.Length];
int count= memoryStream.Read(readContent, 0, readContent.Length);
for (int i =count; i < memoryStream.Length; i++)
{
    readContent[i] = Convert.ToByte(memoryStream.ReadByte());
}
string result= Encoding.UTF8.GetString(readContent);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

## BufferedStream

Adds a buffering layer to read and write operations on another stream.

A buffer is a block of bytes in memory used to cache data, thereby reducing the number of calls to the operating system. Buffers improve read and write performance. A buffer can be used for either reading or writing, but never both simultaneously. The `Read` and `Write` methods of BufferedStream automatically maintain the buffer.

```csharp
FileStream fileStream = File.Create("Sample.txt");
BufferedStream memoryStream = new BufferedStream(fileStream);
string content = "This is file content";
byte[] contentInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

//Write into file
memoryStream.Write(contentInBytes, 0, contentInBytes.Length);

//Set the position to the begninig of stream
memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

//Read from file
byte[] readContent = new byte[memoryStream.Length];
int count= memoryStream.Read(readContent, 0, readContent.Length);
for (int i =count; i < memoryStream.Length; i++)
{
    readContent[i] = Convert.ToByte(memoryStream.ReadByte());
}
string result= Encoding.UTF8.GetString(readContent);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```
