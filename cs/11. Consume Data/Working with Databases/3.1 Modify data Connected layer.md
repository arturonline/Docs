# Modify data

In a connected architecture, you connect to the database and fetch the data from there.

## DataReader (connected model)

`DataReader` as the name suggests reads data from a database. It is the fastest technique to fetch records from database and it works only in Forward direction meaning a row read once cannot be read again and is **ReadOnly** .

The `Read()` function of the `DataReader` reads one row at a time in memory and if a row is read then the function returns *True* else *False*:

```csharp
string constring = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["constr"].ConnectionString;
using (SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(constring))
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT Name, City FROM Persons", con))
    {
        cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
        con.Open();
        SqlDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader();
        while (dr.Read())
        {
            string name = dr["Name"].ToString();
            string city = dr["City"].ToString();
            Response.Write("Name: " + name);
            Response.Write("City: " + city);
        }
        con.Close();
    }
}
```
