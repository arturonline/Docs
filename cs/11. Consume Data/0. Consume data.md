# Consume Data

## ADO.NET

ADO.NET is a set of object-oriented libraries used to interact with a database. It enables you to connect with a database and perform different database-oriented operations on it, such as a CRUD operation (Create, Read, Update, and Delete data).

You can also store and request data from an external web service and retrieve the response in `JavaScript Object Notation` (JSON) or `Extensible Markup Language` (XML). The .NET Framework helps you execute these requests and parse the returned data.

This can be achieved by interacting with a database or external web service to insert or retrieve data whenever you require.
