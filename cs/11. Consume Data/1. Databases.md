# Working with a Database

[Databases in MS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/retrieving-and-modifying-data)

Conceptually, ADO.NET consists of three layers, i.e., the different ways of interaction with a database. Each layer has its own suitability according to the scenario.

1. Connected Layer
2. Disconnected Layer
3. Entity Framework

## Connected Layer

When using the **connected** parts of ADO.NET, you explicitly connect to a database and use that as the underlying source. You use a `DataReader` to retrieve a read-only, forward-only stream of data from a database. Results are returned as the query executes, and are stored in the network buffer on the client until you request them using the `Read()` method of the DataReader.

```csharp
string con = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";

string command = "select * from Student";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con);

SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

int StudentID = 0;
string StudentName = null;
if (reader.HasRows)
{
    while (reader.Read())
    {
        StudentID = int.Parse(reader[0].ToString());//0 index means first clm in the table which is StudentID
        StudentName = reader["StudentName"].ToString();//it will fetch the value of provided clm name
    }
}
reader.Close();
con.Close();

Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + StudentID);
Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + StudentName);
```

## Disconnected Layer

In the **disconnected** world, `DataAdapters` act like a bridge between data in memory and a database. You can perform *insert*, *update*, *delete*, or *read* query while the data in memory as source and then reconnect to a database to sync the changes.

Those in-memory caches of data retrieved from a database are `DataSet` objects. `DataSets` are collection of `DataTables`. `DataTables` represent one table of in-memory data.

```csharp
string con = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";
string command = "select * from Student";

SqlDataAdapter ad = new SqlDataAdapter(command, con);
DataTable tbl = new DataTable();
ad.Fill(tbl);//Now the data in DataTable (memory)

con.Close();//connection closed

foreach (DataRow item in tbl.Rows)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + item[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + item[1]);
}
```

When DataAdapter’s Fill method is called, a query will be executed and the `Fill()` method will populate the `DataTable` (get the data and map into DataTable).

DataTable doesn’t need to keep open the connection to populate the data, and it has better performance than a connected layer as it deals with the data present in memory, which is quickly accessible.

You can also use `DataSet` instead of DataTable when expecting multiple results. The working is the same except it can return multiple tables. DataSet has the property of Table by which you can iterate over specific table data.

```csharp
string connectionString = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";
SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
con.Open();

string command = "select * from Student";//Currently has One Row(for example)
SqlDataAdapter ad = new SqlDataAdapter(command, con);

DataTable tbl = new DataTable();
ad.Fill(tbl);//Now the data in DataTable (memory)

//Data in Memory (One Row)
foreach (DataRow item in tbl.Rows)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + item[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + item[1]);
}

//New Record to add in DataTable
DataRow newRow = tbl.NewRow();
newRow["StudentID"] = 2;
newRow["StudentName"] = "Ali Asad";
tbl.Rows.Add(newRow);

//Two Rows(As new row added to DataTable)
foreach (DataRow item in tbl.Rows)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + item[0]);
    Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + item[1]);
}

//Now newRow has to add in Database(Pass newRow Parameters to this insert query)
string newCommand = @"Insert into Student(StudentID,StudentName) Values(@StudentID,@StudentName)";
SqlCommand insertCommand = new SqlCommand(newCommand, con);

//Create the parameters
insertCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@StudentID", SqlDbType.Int, Int32.
MaxValue,"StudentID"));
insertCommand.Parameters.Add(new SqlParameter("@StudentName", SqlDbType.VarChar,
40,"StudentName"));

//Associate Insert Command to DataAdapter so that it could add into Database
ad.InsertCommand = insertCommand;

ad.Update(tbl);

con.Close();
```

In this example, a Parameter property of a Command object is used, which takes new parameter related data, such as *column name*, *column size*, and *parameter name*. `newRow` added in DataTable (new record in memory) but didn’t add in database, but later used the `Update()` method of DataAdpater, which reconnects to a database to take changes (i.e., updated DataTable mapped to a database).

You can perform further operations likewise, i.e., to delete data, write a delete query, and associate it with a DataAdapter object like `da.DeleteCommand=””;,` etc.

## Entity Framework

You can create complex applications by manually writing your SQL queries and executing them against the database. But when your application grows, and you want to use an object oriented design, you start running into problems. Of course, you can map the results of your query to objects and create queries from the changes to your objects, but this is a difficult task. Even if you like the challenge, this is not something that will add value for your customers.

This is where Object Relational Mapping (ORM) software comes into play. One such ORM is Microsoft’s open source Entity Framework, which lessens the burden of the tedious work of mapping your objects, constructing queries, and keeping track of all the changes.

Entity Framework gives you the object-oriented way to interact with a database. Using this conceptual layer of ADO.NET, you don’t need to worry about connection or command-like objects. This kind of stuff is automatically handled by Entity Framework.

LINQ is used instead of SQL and you can use one of LINQ’s types with your data source provided by ADO.NET (Database).
