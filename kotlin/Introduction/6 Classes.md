# Classes

```Kotlin
class Invoice { ... }

class Empty // if the class has no body, curly braces can be omitted.
```

## Class Constructor

A class in Kotlin can have a primary constructor and one or more secondary constructors. The primary constructor is part of the class header: it goes after the class name (and optional type parameters).

```kotlin
class Person constructor(firstName: String) { ... }
```

If the primary constructor does not have any annotations or visibility modifiers, the constructor keyword can be omitted:

```kotlin
class Person(firstName: String) { ... }
```

### Init block

The primary constructor CANNOT contain any logic. Initialization code can be placed in **initializer blocks**, which are prefixed with the `init` keyword.

During an instance initialization, the initializer blocks are executed in the same order as they appear in the class body, interleaved with the property initializers:

```kotlin
class InitOrderDemo(name: String) {
    val firstProperty = "First property: $name".also(::println)

    init {
        println("First initializer block that prints ${name}")
    }

    val secondProperty = "Second property: ${name.length}".also(::println)

    init {
        println("Second initializer block that prints ${name.length}")
    }
}
```

Note that parameters of the primary constructor can be used in the initializer blocks. They can also be used in property initializers declared in the class body:

```kotlin
class Customer(name: String) {
    val customerKey = name.toUpperCase()
}
```

In fact, for declaring properties and initializing them from the primary constructor, Kotlin has a concise syntax:

```kotlin
class Person(val firstName: String, val lastName: String, var age: Int) { ... }
```

### Secondary Constructors

The class can also declare secondary constructors, which are prefixed with constructor:

```kotlin
class Person {
    constructor(parent: Person) {
        parent.children.add(this)
    }
}
```

If the class has a primary constructor, each secondary constructor needs to delegate to the primary constructor, either directly or indirectly through another secondary constructor(s). Delegation to another constructor of the same class is done using the `this` keyword:

```kotlin
class Person(val name: String) {
    constructor(name: String, parent: Person) : this(name) {
        parent.children.add(this)
    }
}
```

Note that code in initializer blocks effectively becomes part of the primary constructor. Delegation to the primary constructor happens as the first statement of a secondary constructor, so the code in all initializer blocks is executed before the secondary constructor body. Even if the class has no primary constructor, the delegation still happens implicitly, and the initializer blocks are still executed:

```kotlin
class Constructors {
    init {
        println("Init block")
    }
â€‹
    constructor(i: Int) {
        println("Constructor")
    }
}
```

If a non-abstract class does not declare any constructors (primary or secondary), it will have a generated primary constructor with no arguments. The visibility of the constructor will be public. If you do not want your class to have a public constructor, you need to declare an empty primary constructor with non-default visibility:

```kotlin
class DontCreateMe private constructor () { ... }
```
