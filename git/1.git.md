WorkFlow:

## start watching a directory for changes

Local:

`git init`

On-line:

`git clone www.URL.com`
`git clone /path/to/folder`

## Add changes

when one or several files are ready you send them to the staging area:

`git add xxx`<br>
`git add .`<br>
`git add *`<br>

The `add` command tells Git that you want to include updates to a particular file in the next commit.

Instead of committing all of the changes you've made since the last commit, the stage area lets you group related changes into highly focused snapshots before actually committing it to the project history.

## Commiting the propose changes

Once you have recopiled the files you want in the staging area, you commit those changes to the repository.

`git commit -m "message"`

Whenever you add, edit, or delete a file, you're making a commit, and adding them to your branch. This process of adding commits keeps track of your progress as you work on a feature branch.

Commits also create a transparent history of your work that others can follow to understand what you've done and why. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made.

## Undo Changes in the working directory ( not staged changes)

Use the checkout command in order to check out the repository's version of the hello.html file.

```sh
git checkout file.txt
```

## Cancel Staged Changes

```sh
git reset HEAD file.txt # reset staged changes
git checkout file.txt   # reset command does not change the working directory, therefore, whe working directory needs to be reset too.
```

## Amending commits

```sh 
add file.txt
git commit -m "Added copyright statement"
# ups! we forget to add the email
# change the file and commit amend
git add file.txt 
git commit -m "Added copyright statement"it commit --amend -m "Added copyright statement with email"
```

## Cancelling commits

To cancel a commit we will create a new commit, cancelling the unwanted changes.

```sh
git add hello.html
git commit -m "Oops, we didn't want this commit"

git revert HEAD
```

We may cancel any random commit in history, pointing out its hash value.

## commands

 `Git log` is a journal that remembers all the changes we've committed so far, in the order we committed them.

There are several Git config options to adjust the default log output format:

```sh
git config --global format.pretty '%h %ad | %s%d [%an]'
git config --global log.date short
```
