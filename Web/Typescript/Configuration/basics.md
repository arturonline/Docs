# Typescript

TypeScript is a super-set of ES6. That means whatever features we have in ES6 are also in TypeScript with some extra features on top, such as static typing and richer syntax.

Browser canâ€™t run TypeScript so we first need to transpile it into JavaScript.

## Installation

We can install typescript via npm

```Typescript
npm install -g typescript
```

## Running

Create a file called `hello.ts`.
We can compile a typescript file into a javascript file by calling:

```Typescript
tsc hello.ts
```

This generates a file called `hello.js` And we can execute that file by using node.

We can watch a typescript file for changes and compile it automatically with:

```Typescript
tsc -w hello.ts
```

We can provide configuration on the command line, like so:

```Typescript
tsc -t ES6 -w hello.ts
```
