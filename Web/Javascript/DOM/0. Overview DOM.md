# Browser environment

The JavaScript language was initially created for web browsers. Since then, it has evolved and become a language with many uses and platforms.

A host environment provides platform-specific objects and functions additional to the language core. Web browsers give a means to control web pages. Node.js provides server-side features, and so on.

Here’s a bird’s-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web-browser:

## BOM

Browsers feature a Browser Object Model (BOM) that allows access and manipulation of the browser window. Using the BOM, developers can move the window, change text in the status bar, and perform other actions that do not directly relate to the page content.

The BOM includes the objects **navigator**, **history**, **screen**, **location** and **document** which are children of **window**. In the document node is the DOM (Document Object Model) which represents the contents of the page.

Because no standards exist for the BOM, each browser has its own implementation.

## DOM

At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model (DOM). This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.

There are many types of nodes, but there are three main ones that we work with most often:

Node Type    | Value | Example
-------------|-------|------------------------------------
ELEMENT_NODE | 1     | The `<body>` element
TEXT_NODE    | 3     | Text that is not part of an element
COMMENT_NODE | 8     | `<!-- an HTML comment -->`

### DOM Tree

The backbone of an HTML document are `tags`. Every HTML-tag is an object and the text inside a tag it is an object as well. Spaces and newlines – are totally valid characters, they form text nodes and become a part of the DOM.
