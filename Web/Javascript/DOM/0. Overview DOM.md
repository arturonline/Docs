# Access the DOM

JavaScript can access all the elements in a webpage making use of Document Object Model (DOM). At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model (DOM). This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.

## DOM

The DOM consists of a tree of objects called **nodes**. There are many types of nodes, but there are three main ones that we work with most often:

Node Type | Value | Example
-|-|-
ELEMENT_NODE | 1 | The <body> element
TEXT_NODE | 3 | Text that is not part of an element
COMMENT_NODE | 8 | <!-- an HTML comment -->
