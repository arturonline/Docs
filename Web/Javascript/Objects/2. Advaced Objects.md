# Advanced Objects

## Factory Functions

A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances.

  ```Javascript
  function robotFactory(model, mobile) {
    return {
      model: model,
      mobile: mobile,
      beep() {
        console.log('Beep Boop')
      }
    }
  }

  const tinCan = robotFactory('P-500', true);
  ```

### Property value ShortHand

We can use a destructuring technique, called property value shorthand, to save ourselves some keystrokes.

- Normal version:

  ```javascript
  const monsterFactory = (name, age) => {
    return {
      name: name,
      age: age
    }
  };
  ```

- With destructuring:

  ```javascript
  const monsterFactory = (name, age) => {
    return {
      name,
      age
    }
  };
  ```

## Destructured Assignment

We often want to extract key-value pairs from objects and save them as variables. Take for example the following object:

  ```javascript
  const vampire = {
    name: 'Dracula',
    residence: 'Transylvania',
    preferences: {
      day: 'stay inside',
      night: 'satisfy appetite'
    }
  };
  ```

If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could using the following code:

  ```javascript
  const residence = vampire.residence;
  console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
  ```

However, we can also take advantage of destructured assignment. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an objectâ€™s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object:

```javascript
const { residence } = vampire;
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
```

We can even use destructured assignment to grab nested properties of an object:

```javascript
const { day } = vampire.preferences;
console.log(day); // Prints 'stay inside'
```

## Constructor Functions

  ```Javascript
  function Person(name) {
      this.name = name;
      this.greet = function() {
          console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
      }
  }

  let person = new Person("Jack Johnson");
  ```
