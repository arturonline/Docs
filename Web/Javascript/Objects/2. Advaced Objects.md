# Advanced Objects

## Factory Functions

A factory function is a function that returns an object and can be reused to make multiple object instances.

  ```Javascript
  function robotFactory(model, mobile) {
    return {
      model: model,
      mobile: mobile,
      beep() {
        console.log('Beep Boop')
      }
    }
  }

  const tinCan = robotFactory('P-500', true);
  ```

### Property value ShortHand

We can use a destructuring technique, called property value shorthand, to save ourselves some keystrokes.

- Normal version:

  ```javascript
  const monsterFactory = (name, age) => {
    return {
      name: name,
      age: age
    }
  };
  ```

- With destructuring:

  ```javascript
  const monsterFactory = (name, age) => {
    return {
      name,
      age
    }
  };
  ```

## Constructor Functions

  ```Javascript
  function Person(name) {
      this.name = name;
      this.greet = function() {
          console.log("Hello, I'm " + this.name);
      }
  }

  let person = new Person("Jack Johnson");
  ```

## Constructor functions

```Javascript
function Person(name, position) {
  this.name = name;
  this.position = position;
}
```

## Methods

Methods can be defined on constructor functions by assigning a function to a property.

```Javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.hi = function() {
    console.log('Hi! My name is ' + this.name);
  };
}

let eminem = new Person('Slim Shady');
eminem.hi(); // Hi! my name is Slim Shady
```

Although methods can be defined this way, this approach does have a downside. Every time an instance of Person is created, a new function is defined and assigned to the hi property of that object. If we create 5 Person objects, they will all have their own hi methods that do the same thing. A more efficient way to do this is to define hi once, and have each Person object use that same function reference. To do this, we can use a function’s prototype.

```Javascript
function Person(name) {
  this.name = name;
}

Person.prototype.hi = function() {
  console.log('Hi! My name is ' + this.name);
};

let david = new Person('David');
david.hi(); // Hi! My name is David

let patrick = new Person('Patrick');
patrick.hi(); // Hi! My name is Patrick
```

Whenever a Person instance is created, the object will inherit any properties or methods defined on Person.prototype.

Anything on the prototype is shared across all object instances of that constructor, typically you only see methods defined on the prototype and properties stored on the constructed object itself.

## Destructured Assignment

We often want to extract key-value pairs from objects and save them as variables. Take for example the following object:

  ```javascript
  const vampire = {
    name: 'Dracula',
    residence: 'Transylvania',
    preferences: {
      day: 'stay inside',
      night: 'satisfy appetite'
    }
  };
  ```

If we wanted to extract the residence property as a variable, we could using the following code:

  ```javascript
  const residence = vampire.residence;
  console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
  ```

However, we can also take advantage of destructured assignment. In destructured assignment we create a variable with the name of an object’s key that is wrapped in curly braces { } and assign to it the object:

```javascript
const { residence } = vampire;
console.log(residence); // Prints 'Transylvania'
```

We can even use destructured assignment to grab nested properties of an object:

```javascript
const { day } = vampire.preferences;
console.log(day); // Prints 'stay inside'
```
