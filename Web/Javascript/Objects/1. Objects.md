# Objects

## Object literals

An object in JavaScript is a collection of key-value pairs (a.k.a. properties). A key’s value can be of any data type in the language including functions or other objects.

```Javascript
var human = {
    firstName: "Virat",
    lastName: "Kohli",
    age: 30,
    fullName: function(){
        return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
    }
}
```

## Properties

### Acces a property value

1. With **dot** notation:

    ```javascript
    let spaceship = {
    homePlanet: 'Earth',
    color: 'silver'
    };
    spaceship.homePlanet; // Returns 'Earth',
    spaceship.color; // Returns 'silver',
    ```

2. With **bracket** notation:

    ```javascript
    ['A', 'B', 'C'][0]; // Returns 'A'
    ```

With bracket notation you can also use a variable inside the brackets to select the keys of an object. This can be especially helpful when working with functions:

  ```javascript
  let returnAnyProp = (objectName, propName) => objectName[propName];
  returnAnyProp(spaceship, 'homePlanet'); // Returns 'Earth'
  ```

>⚠️ We *must* use bracket notation when accessing keys that have numbers, spaces, or special characters in them.

### Modify a property value

It’s important to know that although we can’t reassign an object declared with **const**, we can still mutate it, meaning we can add new properties and change the properties that are there.

```javascript
const spaceship = {type: 'shuttle'};
spaceship = {type: 'alien'}; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
spaceship.type = 'alien'; // Changes the value of the type property
spaceship.speed = 'Mach 5'; // Creates a new key of 'speed' with a value of 'Mach 5'
```

### Add and Remove a property from an instance of an object

```Javascript
myHuman.nationality = 'English';
```

```Javascript
const spaceship = {
  'Fuel Type': 'Turbo Fuel',
  homePlanet: 'Earth',
  mission: 'Explore the universe'
};

delete spaceship.mission;  // Removes the mission property
```

### Add a Method to an instance of an object

```Javascript
myHuman.name = function () {
    return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
};
```

## Methods

When the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method. A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.

```Javascript
const alienShip = {
  invade: function () {
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet.')
  }
};
```

With the new method syntax introduced in ES6 we can omit the colon and the function keyword.

```Javascript
const alienShip = {
  invade () {
    console.log('Hello! We have come to dominate your planet.')
  }
};
```

## Looping Through Objects

Loops are programming tools that repeat a block of code until a condition is met. We learned how to iterate through arrays using their numerical indexing, but the key-value pairs in objects aren’t ordered! JavaScript has given us alternative solution for iterating through objects with the `for...in` syntax .

`for...in` will execute a given block of code for each property in an object.

```javascript
let spaceship = {
    crew: {
    captain: {
        name: 'Lily',
        degree: 'Computer Engineering',
        cheerTeam() { console.log('You got this!') }
        },
    'chief officer': {
        name: 'Dan',
        degree: 'Aerospace Engineering',
        agree() { console.log('I agree, captain!') }
        },
    medic: {
        name: 'Clementine',
        degree: 'Physics',
        announce() { console.log(`Jets on!`) } },
    translator: {
        name: 'Shauna',
        degree: 'Conservation Science',
        powerFuel() { console.log('The tank is full!') }
        }
    }
};

for(let crewMember in spaceship.crew) {
    console.log(`${spaceship.crew[crewMember].name}: ${spaceship.crew[crewMember].degree}`)  
}

// Lily: Computer Engineering
// Dan: Aerospace Engineering
// Clementine: Physics
// Shauna: Conservation Science
```

## Scope

Objects are passed by reference. This means when we pass a variable assigned to an object into a function as an argument, the computer interprets the parameter name as pointing to the space in memory holding that object. As a result, functions which change object properties actually mutate the object permanently (even when the object is assigned to a const variable).

```javascript
const spaceship = {
  homePlanet : 'Earth',
  color : 'silver'
};

let paintIt = obj => {
  obj.color = 'glorious gold'
};

paintIt(spaceship);

spaceship.color // Returns 'glorious gold'
```
