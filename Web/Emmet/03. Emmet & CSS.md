# Using Emmet with CSS

Emmet also includes a number of abbreviations to help you generate CSS code. These abbreviations are often shorthand versions of the CSS property names. You can find a full list of the CSS abbreviations that are available by examining the Emmet snippets.json file.

```css
tsh
```

This abbreviation will generate the CSS syntax needed for the text-shadow property.

```css
text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
```

Adding a hyphen - before the abbreviation will trigger Emmet to generate vendor prefixes for the property.

```css
-tsh
```

If your text editor supports tabstops Emmet will place multiple cursors so that you can fill out values for all of the vendor-prefixed properties simultaneously.

```css
-webkit-text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
-moz-text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
-ms-text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
-o-text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
text-shadow: hoff voff blur #000
```
