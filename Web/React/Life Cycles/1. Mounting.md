# Mounting Lifecycle Methods

A component “mounts” when it renders for the first time. It automatically calls three methods, in order:

- `componentWillMount`
- `render`
- `componentDidMount`

## componentWillMount

When a component renders for the first time, `componentWillMount` gets called right before **render**, and only execute the first time.

## render

Whenever a component mounts, `componentWillMount` is called first, followed by `render`, followed by `componentDidMount`.

render belongs to two categories: mounting lifecycle methods, and updating lifecycle methods.

## componentDidMount

When a component renders for the first time, `componentDidMount` gets called right after the HTML from render has finished loading.

componentDidMount gets used a lot! If you want something to happen right after the very first rendering… that’s exactly what `componentDidMount` is for!

If your React app uses AJAX to fetch initial data from an API, then `componentDidMount` is the place to make that AJAX call. More generally, `componentDidMount` is a good place to connect a React app to external applications, such as web APIs or JavaScript frameworks. `componentDidMount` is also the place to set timers using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.
