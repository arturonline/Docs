# Components

React applications are made out of components.

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is usually responsible for one job, that job is often to render some HTML.

There is two types of components:

## #1. Stateless Functional Components

This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single `props` (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element.

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```

## #2. Class Components

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}

ReactDOM.render(<MyComponentClass />, document.getElementById("app"));
```

## Creating a Component Instance

To make an instance of a `React component`, you write a JSX element.

```jsx
<MyComponentClass />
```

JSX elements can be either HTML, or component instances. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two. In a JSX element, that capitalized first letter says, “I will be a component instance and not an HTML tag.”
