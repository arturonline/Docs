# Componentes

React applications are made out of components.

A component is a small, reusable chunk of code that is responsible for one job, that job is often to render some HTML. To create your own component class, you must subclass `React.Component`.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';

class MyComponentClass extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <MyComponentClass />,
  document.getElementById('app')
);
```

## Component Class

A `component class` is like a factory that builds components. It builds these components by consulting a set of instructions, which you must provide. There is only one property that you have to include in your code: a **render method**.

A **render method** is a property whose name is `render`, and whose value is a `function`. The term *“render method”* can refer to the entire property, or to just the function part.

```jsx
class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {}
}
```

A render method must contain a **return** statement. Usually, this **return** statement returns a `JSX expression`:

```jsx
class ComponentFactory extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

## Creating a Component Instance

To make an instance of a `React component`, you write a JSX element.

```jsx
<MyComponentClass />
```

JSX elements can be either HTML, or component instances. JSX uses capitalization to distinguish between the two. In a JSX element, that capitalized first letter says, “I will be a component instance and not an HTML tag.”
