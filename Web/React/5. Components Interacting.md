# Components Interacting

React apps are made out of components, but what makes React special isn’t components themselves. What makes React special is the ways in which components interact.

```jsx
class Example extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello world</h1>;
  }
}
```

Render methods can also return another kind of JSX: component instances.

```jsx
class OMG extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Whooaa!</h1>;
  }
}

class Crazy extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <OMG />;
  }
}
```

In the above example, Crazy‘s render method returns an instance of the OMG component class. You could say that Crazy renders an `<OMG />`.
