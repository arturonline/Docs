# JSX

## JSX Outer Elements

There’s a rule that we haven’t mentioned: a JSX expression must have exactly one outermost element.

In other words, this code will work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <div id="i-am-the-outermost-element">
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
  </div>
);
```

But this code will not work:

```jsx
const paragraphs = (
  <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
  <p>I, too, am a paragraph.</p>
);
```

The first opening tag and the final closing tag of a JSX expression must belong to the same JSX element!

It’s easy to forget about this rule, and end up with errors that are tough to diagnose.

If you notice that a JSX expression has multiple outer elements, the solution is usually simple: wrap the JSX expression in a `<div></div>`.

## class vs className

Grammar in JSX is mostly the same as in HTML, but there are subtle differences to watch out for. Probably the most frequent of these involves the word class.

JSX gets translated into JavaScript, and class is a reserved word in JavaScript, so in JSX, you can’t use the word `class`! You have to use `className` instead:

```jsx
<h1 className="big">Hey</h1>
```

## Self-Closing Tags

Most HTML elements use two tags: an opening tag (`<div>`), and a closing tag (`</div>`). However, some HTML elements such as `<img>` and `<input>` use only one tag.

When you write a single tag in HTML, it is optional to include a forward-slash immediately before the final angle-bracket:

Fine in HTML:

```jsx
  <br />

  <br>
```

But!

In JSX, you have to include the slash. If you write a self-closing tag in JSX and forget the slash, you will raise an error:

Fine in JSX:

```jsx
  <br />
```

NOT FINE AT ALL in JSX:

```jsx
  <br>
```

## Curly Braces in JSX

Any code in between the tags of a JSX element will be read as JSX, not as regular JavaScript.
You can inject javascript by wrapping the code in curly braces:

```jsx
ReactDOM.render(<h1>{2 + 3}</h1>, document.getElementById('app'));
// 5
```
