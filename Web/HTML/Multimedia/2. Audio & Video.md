# Audio & Video

## The `<video>` element

```html
<video src="rabbit320.webm" controls>
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.webm">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

The features of note are:

**src**
In the same way as for the <img> element, the src (source) attribute contains a path to the video you want to embed. It works in exactly the same way.

**controls**
Users must be able to control video and audio playback (it's especially critical for people who have epilepsy.) You must either use the controls attribute to include the browser's own control interface, or build your interface using the appropriate JavaScript API. At minimum, the interface must include a way to start and stop the media, and to adjust the volume.

**Fallback content**
The paragraph inside the `<video>` tags this will be displayed if the browser accessing the page doesn't support the `<video>` element, allowing us to provide a fallback for older browsers. This can be anything you like; in this case we've provided a direct link to the video file, so the user can at least access it some way regardless of what browser they are using.

### Supporting multiple formats

Different browsers support different video (and audio) formats.

```html
<video controls>
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

### Other controls

```html
<video controls width="400" height="400"
       autoplay loop muted
       poster="poster.png">
  <source src="rabbit320.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="rabbit320.webm" type="video/webm">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is a <a href="rabbit320.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
</video>
```

## The `<audio>` element

```html
<audio controls>
  <source src="viper.mp3" type="audio/mp3">
  <source src="viper.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
  <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. Here is a <a href="viper.mp3">link to the audio</a> instead.</p>
</audio>
```

The `<audio>` element works in exactly the same way as the `<video>` element, with a few small differences:

- The `<audio>` element doesn't support the **width**/**height** attributes.
- It also doesn't support the **poster** attribute.

## Displaying text tracks

Wouldn't it be nice to be able to provide these people with a transcript of the words being spoken in the audio/video? Well, thanks to `HTML5 video` you can, with the `WebVTT` format and the `<track>` element.

```html
<video controls>
    <source src="example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    <source src="example.webm" type="video/webm">
    <track kind="subtitles" src="subtitles_en.vtt" srclang="en">
</video>
```
