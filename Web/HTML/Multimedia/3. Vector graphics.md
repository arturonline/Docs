# Vector Graphics

On the web, you'll work with two types of image:

- **Raster images** contains information showing exactly where each pixel is to be placed, and exactly what color it should be. Popular web raster formats include Bitmap (.bmp), PNG (.png), JPEG (.jpg), and GIF (.gif.)

- **Vector images** contains shape and path definitions that the computer can use to work out what the image should look like when rendered on the screen. The SVG format allows us to create powerful vector graphics for use on the Web.

## SVG

SVG is an `XML-based` language for describing **vector images**. It's basically markup, like `HTML`, except that you've got many different elements for defining the shapes you want to appear in your image, and the effects you want to apply to those shapes. SVG is for marking up graphics, not content.

```css
<svg version="1.1"
     baseProfile="full"
     width="300" height="200"
     xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="black" />
  <circle cx="150" cy="100" r="90" fill="blue" />
</svg>
```

To embed an SVG via an `<img>` element, you just need to reference it in the src attribute as you'd expect. You will need a height or a width attribute (or both if your SVG has no inherent aspect ratio):

```html
<img
    src="equilateral.svg" 
    alt="triangle with all three sides equal"
    height="87px"
    width="100px" />
```

You can also open up the SVG file in a text editor, copy the SVG code, and paste it into your HTML document â€” this is sometimes called putting your SVG inline, or inlining SVG:

```html
<svg width="300" height="200">
    <rect width="100%" height="100%" fill="green" />
</svg>
```
