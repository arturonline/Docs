# Marking up text

## Headings

```HTML
<h1>My main title</h1>
<h2>My top level heading</h2>
<h3>My subheading</h3>
<h4>My sub-subheading</h4>
```

## Paragraph

```HTML
<p>This is a single paragraph</p>
```

## Ordered & Unordered lists

```HTML
<!-- Unordered list: <ul> -->
<!-- Ordered list: <ol> -->
<ul>
  <li>technologists</li>
  <li>thinkers</li>
  <li>builders</li>
</ul>
```

## Description Lists

The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers.

Description lists use a different wrapper than the other list types — `<dl>`; in addition each term is wrapped in a `<dt>` (description term) element, and each description is wrapped in a `<dd>` (description definition) element.

```html
<dl>
  <dt>soliloquy</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the audience (but not to other characters.)</dd>
  <dt>monologue</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them with the audience and any other characters present.</dd>
  <dt>aside</dt>
  <dd>In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or piece of additional background information.</dd>
</dl>
```

## Emphasis (italic), Strong (bold)

```html
<p>I am <i>glad</i> you weren't <i>late</i>.</p>
<p>I am <i>glad</i> you weren't <i>late</i>.</p>

<p>This liquid is <strong>highly toxic</strong>.</p>
<p>This liquid is <b>highly toxic</b>.</p>
```

## Blockquote

```html
<blockquote cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/blockquote">
  <p>The <strong>HTML <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> Element</strong> (or <em>HTML Block
  Quotation Element</em>) indicates that the enclosed text is an extended quotation.</p>
</blockquote>
```

Inline quotation:

```html
<p>The quote element — <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> — is <q cite="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/q">intended
for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks.</q></p>
```

## Abbreviations

```html
<p>We use <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> to structure our web documents.</p>
```

## Superscript and subscriptSection

You will occasionally need to use superscript and subscript when marking up items like dates, chemical formulae, and mathematical equations so they have the correct meaning. The `<sup>` and `<sub>` elements handle this job. For example:

```html
<p>My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.</p>
<p>Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.</p>
<p>If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.</p>
```

The output of this code looks like so:

My birthday is on the 25<sup>th</sup> of May 2001.

Caffeine's chemical formula is C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

If x<sup>2</sup> is 9, x must equal 3 or -3.

## Code

There are a number of elements available for marking up computer code using HTML:

`<code>`: For marking up generic pieces of computer code.
`<pre>`: For retaining whitespace — if you use indentation or excess whitespace inside your text, browsers will ignore it and you will not see it on your rendered page. If you wrap the text in `<pre></pre>` tags however, your whitespace will be rendered identically to how you see it in your text editor.
`<var>`: For specifically marking up variable names.
`<kbd>`: For marking up keyboard and other types of input entered into the computer.
`<samp>`: For marking up the output of a computer program.

## Time and date

```html
<!-- Standard simple date -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20">20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Just year and month -->
<time datetime="2016-01">January 2016</time>
<!-- Just month and day -->
<time datetime="01-20">20 January</time>
<!-- Just time, hours and minutes -->
<time datetime="19:30">19:30</time>
<!-- You can do seconds and milliseconds too! -->
<time datetime="19:30:01.856">19:30:01.856</time>
<!-- Date and time -->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30">7.30pm, 20 January 2016</time>
<!-- Date and time with timezone offset-->
<time datetime="2016-01-20T19:30+01:00">7.30pm, 20 January 2016 is 8.30pm in France</time>
<!-- Calling out a specific week number-->
<time datetime="2016-W04">The fourth week of 2016</time>
```
