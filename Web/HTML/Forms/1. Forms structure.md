# How to structure an HTML form

Forms are just HTML. This means that you can use all the power of HTML to structure an HTML form.

It's common practice to wrap a label and its widget with a `<div>` or `<p>` elements, as are HTML `lists` (for structuring multiple checkboxes or radio buttons).

In addition to the `<fieldset>` element, it's also common practice to use HTML titles (e.g. `<h1>`, `<h2>`) and sectioning (e.g. `<section>`) to structure a complex form.

This has each separate section of functionality contained in `<section>` elements, and a `<fieldset>` to contain the radio buttons.

>❗ It's strictly forbidden to nest a form inside another form.

Above all, it is up to you to find a style that you find comfortable to code with, and which also results in accessible, usable forms.

## The `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements

The `<fieldset>` element is a convenient way to create groups of widgets that share the same purpose, for styling and semantic purposes. You can label a `<fieldset>` by including a `<legend>` element just below the opening `<fieldset>` tag. The text content of the `<legend>` formally describes the purpose of the `<fieldset>` it is included inside.

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Fruit juice size</legend>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_1" value="small">
      <label for="size_1">Small</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_2" value="medium">
      <label for="size_2">Medium</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_3" value="large">
      <label for="size_3">Large</label>
    </p>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Fruit juice size</legend>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_1" value="small">
      <label for="size_1">Small</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_2" value="medium">
      <label for="size_2">Medium</label>
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="radio" name="size" id="size_3" value="large">
      <label for="size_3">Large</label>
    </p>
  </fieldset>
</form>

## The `<label>` element

The `<label>` element is the formal way to define a label for an HTML form widget.

```html
<label for="name">Name:</label> <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
```

```html
<label for="name">
  Name: <input type="text" id="name" name="user_name">
</label>
```

### Multiple labels

Strictly speaking, you can put multiple labels on a single widget, but this is not a good idea as some assistive technologies can have trouble handling them. In the case of multiple labels, you should nest a widget and its labels inside a single `<label>` element.

```html
<p>Required fields are followed by <abbr title="required">*</abbr>.</p>

<!-- So this: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <label for="username"><abbr title="required">*</abbr></label>
</div>

<!-- would be better done like this: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">
    <span>Name:</span>
    <input id="username" type="text" name="username">
    <abbr title="required">*</abbr>
  </label>
</div>

<!-- But this is probably best: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">Name: <abbr title="required">*</abbr></label>
  <input id="username" type="text" name="username">
</div>
```

<p>Required fields are followed by <abbr title="required">*</abbr>.</p>

<!-- So this: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="username">
  <label for="username"><abbr title="required">*</abbr></label>
</div>

<!-- would be better done like this: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">
    <span>Name:</span>
    <input id="username" type="text" name="username">
    <abbr title="required">*</abbr>
  </label>
</div>

<!-- But this is probably best: -->
<div>
  <label for="username">Name: <abbr title="required">*</abbr></label>
  <input id="username" type="text" name="username">
</div>

- In the first example, the label is not read out at all with the input — you just get "edit text blank", plus the actual labels are read out separately. The multiple `<label>` elements confuse the screenreader.
- In the second example, things are a bit clearer — the label read out along with the input is "name star name edit text", and the labels are still read out separately. Things are still a bit confusing, but it's a bit better this time because the input has a label associated with it.
- The third example is best — the actual label is read out all together, and the label read out with the input is "name star edit text".
