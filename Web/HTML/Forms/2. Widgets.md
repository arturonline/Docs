## Text input fields

They are a very convenient way to let the user enter any kind of data.

All text fields share some common behaviors:

- They can be marked as readonly (the user cannot modify the input value) or even disabled (the input value is never sent with the rest of the form data).
- They can have a placeholder; this is text that appears inside the text input box that describes the purpose of the box briefly.
- They can be constrained in size (the physical size of the box) and length (the maximum number of characters that can be entered into the box).
- They can benefit from spell checking, if the browser supports it.

```html
<!-- Single line text field -->
<input type="text" id="comment" name="comment" value="I'm a text field">

<!-- E-mail address field -->
<input type="email" id="email" name="email" multiple>

<!-- Password field-->
<input type="password" id="pwd" name="pwd">

<!-- Search field-->
<input type="search" id="search" name="search">

<!-- Phone number field-->
<input type="tel" id="tel" name="tel">

<!-- URL field-->
<input type="url" id="url" name="url">

<!-- Multi-line text field-->
<textarea cols="30" rows="10" wrap="Soft"></textarea>
```
