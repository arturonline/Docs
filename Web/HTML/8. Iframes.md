# Iframes

`<iframe>` elements are designed to allow you to embed other web documents into the current document. This is great for incorporating third-party content into your website that you might not have direct control over and don't want to have to implement your own version of â€” such as *video* from online video providers, *commenting systems* like Disqus, *maps* from online map providers, *advertising banners*, etc.

```html
<iframe src="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary"
        width="100%" height="500" frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen sandbox>
  <p> <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary">
    Fallback link for browsers that don't support iframes
  </a> </p>
</iframe>
```

Explanation:

**allowfullscreen**
If set, the `<iframe>` is able to be placed in fullscreen mode.

**frameborder**
If set to 1, this tells the browser to draw a border between this frame and other frames, which is the default behaviour. 0 removes the border.

**src**
This attribute, as with `<video>`/`<img>`, contains a path pointing to the URL of the document to be embedded.

**width** and **height**
These attributes specify the width and height you want the iframe to be.

**Fallback content**
In the same way as other similar elements like `<video>`, you can include fallback content between the opening and closing `<iframe></iframe>` tags that will appear if the browser doesn't support the `<iframe>`. In this case, we have included a link to the page instead. It is unlikely that you'll come across any browser that doesn't support `<iframe>`s these days.

**sandbox**
This attribute, which works in slightly more modern browsers than the rest of the `<iframe>` features (e.g. IE 10 and above) requests heightened security settings; we'll say more about this in the next section.

## The `<embed>` and `<object>` elements

These elements are general purpose embedding tools for embedding multiple types of external content, which include plugin technologies like Java Applets and Flash, PDF (which can be shown in a browser with a PDF plugin), and even content like videos, SVG and images!

Here's an example that uses the `<embed>` element to embed a Flash movie:

```html
<embed src="whoosh.swf" quality="medium"
       bgcolor="#ffffff" width="550" height="400"
       name="whoosh" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="sameDomain"
       allowFullScreen="false" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"
       pluginspage="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer">
```

Now let's look at an <object> example that embeds a PDF into a page (see the live example and the source code):

```html
<object data="mypdf.pdf" type="application/pdf"
        width="800" height="1200" typemustmatch>
  <p>You don't have a PDF plugin, but you can <a href="mypdf.pdf">download the PDF file.</a></p>
</object>
```
