# Debugging HTML

## Permissive code

HTML is not compiled into a different form before the browser parses it and shows the result, it is interpreted. The way that browsers parse HTML is a lot more permissive than how programming languages are run:

- **Syntax errors**: These are spelling errors in your code that actually cause the program not to run. These are usually easy to fix as long as you are familiar with the language's syntax and know what the error messages mean.
- **Logic errors**: These are errors where the syntax is actually correct, but the code is not what you intended it to be, meaning that program runs incorrectly. These are often harder to fix than syntax errors, as there isn't an error message to direct you to the source of the error.

When the page doesn't behive as you want check your code and then check the code that the browser has generated. Check the differences to find the problem.

## HTML validation

By using the [Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) â€” created and maintained by the W3C you can get a report to tell you what is wrong with your HTML.
