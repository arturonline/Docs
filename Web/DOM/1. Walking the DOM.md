# Walking the DOM

All operations on the DOM start with the **document object**. From it we can access any node.

The DOM allows us to do anything with elements and their contents, but first we need to reach the corresponding DOM object, get it into a variable, and then we are able to modify it.

The topmost tree nodes are available directly as document properties:

```javascript
<html> = document.documentElement
<body> = document.body
<head> = document.head
```

## Element Navigation

DOM navigation properties are great when elements are close to each other.

Given a DOM node, we can go to its immediate neighbours using navigation properties.

There are two main sets of them:

- For all nodes: `parentNode`, `childNodes`, `firstChild`, `lastChild`, `previousSibling`, `nextSibling`.
- For element nodes only: `parentElement`, `children`, `firstElementChild`, `lastElementChild`, `previousElementSibling`, `nextElementSibling`.

Example:

```javascript
elem.childNodes[0] === elem.firstChild
elem.childNodes[elem.childNodes.length - 1] === elem.lastChild
```

There‚Äôs also a special function `elem.hasChildNodes()` to check whether there are any child nodes.

>üí° Some types of DOM elements, e.g. tables, provide additional properties and collections to access their content.

## DOM collections

As we can see, `ChildNodes` looks like an array. But actually it‚Äôs not an array, but rather a collection ‚Äì a special array-like iterable object.

There are two important consequences:

We can use `for..of` to iterate over it:

```javascript
for (let node of document.body.childNodes) {
  alert(node); // shows all nodes from the collection
}
```

That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs iterable (provides the Symbol.iterator property, as required).

Array methods won‚Äôt work, because it‚Äôs not an array:

```javascript
 alert(document.body.childNodes.filter); // undefined (there's no filter method!)
```

The first thing is nice. The second is tolerable, because we can use Array.from to create a ‚Äúreal‚Äù array from the collection, if we want array methods:

```javascript
alert( Array.from(document.body.childNodes).filter ); // now it's there
```

>‚ö† DOM collections, and even more ‚Äì all navigation properties listed in this chapter are read-only. Changing DOM needs other methods.

## Example

For the page:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <div>Users:</div>
  <ul>
    <li>John</li>
    <li>Pete</li>
  </ul>
</body>
</html>
```

‚ùî How to access:

The `<div>` DOM node?<br>
The `<ul>` DOM node?<br>
The second `<li>` (with Pete)?<br>

üí° Solution:

There are many ways, for instance:

The `<div>` DOM node:

```javascript
document.body.firstElementChild
// or
document.body.children[0]
// or (the first node is space, so we take 2nd)
document.body.childNodes[1]
```

The `<ul>` DOM node:

```javascript
document.body.lastElementChild
// or
document.body.children[1]
```

The second `<li>` (with Pete):

```javascript
// get <ul>, and then get its last element child
document.body.lastElementChild.lastElementChild
```
