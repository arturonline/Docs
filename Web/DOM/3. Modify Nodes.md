# Modify DOM Nodes

## innerHTML

The `innerHTML` property allows to get the HTML inside the element as a string. We can also modify it. So it’s one of most powerful ways to change the page.

```javascript
document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Paragraph changed!";
```

## outerHTML

The `outerHTML` property contains the full HTML of the element. That’s like `innerHTML` plus the element itself.

```html
<div id="elem">Hello <b>World</b></div>

<script>
  alert(elem.outerHTML); // <div id="elem">Hello <b>World</b></div>
</script>
```

> ⚠ Unlike innerHTML, writing to outerHTML does not change the element. Instead, it replaces it as a whole in the outer context.

```html
<div>Hello, world!</div>

<script>
  let div = document.querySelector('div');

  // replace div.outerHTML with <p>...</p>
  div.outerHTML = '<p>A new element!</p>'; // (*)

  // Wow! The div is still the same!
  alert(div.outerHTML); // <div>Hello, world!</div>
</script>
```

## nodeValue/data

The `innerHTML` property is only valid for element nodes.

Other node types have their counterpart: `nodeValue` and `data` properties. These two are almost the same for practical use, there are only minor specification differences. So we’ll use `data`, because it’s shorter.

We can read it, like this:

```html
<body>
  Hello
  <!-- Comment -->
  <script>
    let text = document.body.firstChild;
    alert(text.data); // Hello

    let comment = text.nextSibling;
    alert(comment.data); // Comment
  </script>
</body>
```

## textContent

The textContent provides access to the text inside the element: only text, minus all `<tags>`.

```html
<div id="news">
  <h1>Headline!</h1>
  <p>Martians attack people!</p>
</div>

<script>
  // Headline! Martians attack people!
  alert(news.textContent);
</script>
```

As we can see, only text is returned, as if all `<tags>` were cut out, but the text in them remained.

```html
<div id="elem1"></div>
<div id="elem2"></div>

<script>
  let name = prompt("What's your name?", "<b>Winnie-the-pooh!</b>");

  elem1.innerHTML = name;
  elem2.textContent = name;
</script>
```

1. The first `<div>` gets the name “as HTML”: all tags become tags, so we see the bold name.
1. The second `<div>` gets the name “as text”, so we literally see `<b> winnie-the-pooh! </b>`.

In most cases, we expect the text from a user, and want to treat it as text. We don’t want unexpected HTML in our site. An assignment to textContent does exactly that.
