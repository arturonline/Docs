# Browser environment

The host environment provides platform-specific objects and functions additional to Javascript. **Web browsers** give a means to control web pages. **Node.js** provides server-side features.

Here’s a bird’s-eye view of what we have when JavaScript runs in a web-browser:

## BOM

Browsers feature a Browser Object Model (BOM) that allows access and manipulation of the browser window. Using the BOM, developers can move the window, change text in the status bar, and perform other actions that do not directly relate to the page content.

The BOM includes the objects **navigator**, **history**, **screen**, **location** and **document** which are children of **window**. In the document node is the DOM (Document Object Model) which represents the contents of the page.

Because no standards exist for the BOM, each browser has its own implementation.

## DOM

At the most basic level, a website consists of an HTML document. In addition to parsing the style and structure of the HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the document known as the Document Object Model (DOM). This model allows JavaScript to access the text content and elements of the website document as objects.

There are many types of nodes, but there are three main ones that we work with most often:

Node Type    | Value | Example
-------------|-------|------------------------------------
ELEMENT_NODE | 1     | The `<body>` element
TEXT_NODE    | 3     | Text that is not part of an element
COMMENT_NODE | 8     | `<!-- an HTML comment -->`

### DOM Tree

The backbone of an HTML document are `tags`. Every HTML-tag is an object and the text inside a tag it is an object as well. Spaces and newlines – are totally valid characters, they form text nodes and become a part of the DOM.

### DOM Node Classes

DOM nodes are regular JavaScript objects. They use prototype-based classes for inheritance and all classes of DOM nodes form a single hierarchy. The full set of properties and methods of a given node comes as the result of this inheritance. For instance, an element node corresponding to tag `<a>` has link-related properties, and the one corresponding to `<input>` has input-related properties and so on.

The classes are:

- **EventTarget** – is the root *“abstract”* class. Objects of that class are never created. It serves as a base, so that all DOM nodes support so-called **events**.
- **Node** – is also an “abstract” class, serving as a base for DOM nodes. It provides the core tree functionality: *parentNode*, *nextSibling*, *childNodes* and so on (they are getters). There are concrete node classes that inherit from it, namely: Text for text nodes, Element for element nodes and more exotic ones like Comment for comment nodes.
- **Element** – is a base class for DOM elements. It provides element-level navigation like *nextElementSibling*, *children* and searching methods like `getElementsByTagName`, `querySelector`. In the browser there may be not only HTML, but also XML and SVG documents. The Element class serves as a base for more specific classes: *SVGElement*, *XMLElement* and *HTMLElement*.
- **HTMLElement** – is finally the basic class for all HTML elements. It is inherited by various HTML elements:
  - **HTMLInputElement** – the class for `<input>` elements,
  - **HTMLBodyElement** – the class for `<body>` elements,
  - **HTMLAnchorElement** – the class for `<a>` elements
  - …and so on, each tag has its own class that may provide specific properties and methods.

To see the DOM node class name:

```javascript
// contructor
alert( document.body.constructor.name ); // HTMLBodyElement

// toString
alert( document.body ); // [object HTMLBodyElement]

// instanceof
alert( document.body instanceof HTMLBodyElement ); // true
alert( document.body instanceof HTMLElement ); // true
alert( document.body instanceof Element ); // true
alert( document.body instanceof Node ); // true
alert( document.body instanceof EventTarget ); // true
```

## Tag: NodeName and tagName

```javascript
alert( document.body.nodeName ); // BODY
alert( document.body.tagName ); // BODY
```

TagName is only supported by element nodes (as it originates from Element class), while nodeName:

- for elements it means the same as tagName.
- for other node types (text, comment, etc.) it has a string with the node type.

## The “hidden” property

The “hidden” attribute and the DOM property specifies whether the element is visible or not.

We can use it in HTML or assign using JavaScript, like this:

```html
<div>Both divs below are hidden</div>

<div hidden>With the attribute "hidden"</div>

<div id="elem">JavaScript assigned the property "hidden"</div>

<script>
  elem.hidden = true;
</script>
```

Technically, hidden works the same as `style="display:none"`. But it’s shorter to write.

## More properties

```html
<input type="text" id="elem" value="value">

<script>
  alert(elem.type); // "text"
  alert(elem.id); // "elem"
  alert(elem.value); // value
</script>
```
