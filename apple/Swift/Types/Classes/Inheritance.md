# Inheritance

Classes in Swift can call and access methods, properties, and subscripts belonging to their superclass and can provide their own overriding versions of those methods, properties, and subscripts to refine or modify their behavior.

## Subclassing

Subclassing is the act of basing a new class on an existing class. The subclass inherits characteristics from the existing class, which you can then refine. You can also add new characteristics to the subclass.

```swift
// Base class

class Vehicle {
    var currentSpeed = 0.0
    var description: String {
        return "traveling at \(currentSpeed) miles per hour"
    }
    func makeNoise() {
        // do nothing - an arbitrary vehicle doesn't necessarily make a noise
    }
}
```

```swift
// SubClass

class Bicycle: Vehicle {
    var hasBasket = false
}
```

The new *Bicycle* class automatically gains all of the characteristics of *Vehicle*, such as its `currentSpeed` and `description` properties and its `makeNoise()` method.

In addition to the characteristics it inherits, the *Bicycle* class defines a new stored property, `hasBasket`, with a default value of `false`.

## Overriding

A subclass can provide its own custom implementation of an instance method, type method, instance property, type property, or subscript that it would otherwise inherit from a superclass. This is known as overriding.

To override a characteristic that would otherwise be inherited, you prefix your overriding definition with the **override** keyword.

```swift
class Train: Vehicle {
    override func makeNoise() {
        print("Choo Choo")
    }
}

let train = Train()
train.makeNoise()
// Prints "Choo Choo"
```

You can prevent a method, property, or subscript from being overridden by marking it as final. Do this by writing the final modifier before the method, property, or subscriptâ€™s introducer keyword (such as final var, final func, final class func, and final subscript).
