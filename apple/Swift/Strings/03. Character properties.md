# Character Properties

Swift 5 adds convenient character properties. Definitions are from the Unicode standards.

Note: These proprerties operate on `characters`, not strings.

## Testing For ASCII

Test if a character is ASCII (note that these properties operate on characters not strings):

```swift
let a = "A" as Character
let pi = "Ï€" as Character
a.isASCII               // true
pi.isASCII              // false
```

The `asciiValue` property is an optional integer that returns the ASCII value (or nil if the character is not ASCII):

```swift
a.asciiValue            // Int? (65)
pi.asciiValue           // nil
```

## Testing For Whitespace and New Lines

The `isWhitespace` property tests for spaces and other separator characters:

```swift
let tab = "\t" as Character
tab.isWhitespace        // true
```

A new line character is also classed as whitespace. The `isNewline` property tests more specifically for it (and other line separators):

```swift
let newline = "\n" as Character
newline.isWhitespace    // true
newline.isNewline       // true
```

## Testing For Numbers

Test for numbers and whole numbers:

```swift
let five = "5" as Character
let half = "Â½" as Character
five.isNumber           // true
half.isNumber           // true
```

If the character is a whole number then `wholeNumberValue` gives you the numeric value:

```swift
five.isWholeNumber      // true
five.wholeNumberValue   // Int? (5)
half.isWholeNumber      // false
half.wholeNumberValue   // nil
```

This also works for hexadecimal characters (upper or lower case):

```swift
let a = "A" as Character
a.isHexDigit            // true
a.hexDigitValue         // Int? (10)
```

## Testing For Letters

Does the character represent an alphabetic letter:

```swift
a.isLetter              // true
pi.isLetter             // true (Greek alphabet)

let scream = "ðŸ˜±" as Character
scream.isLetter         // false
```

## Testing For Symbols

Test if a character is a symbol:

```swift
let smiley = "ðŸ˜€" as Character
smiley.isSymbol         // true
smiley.isLetter         // false

let plus = "+" as Character
plus.isSymbol           // true
plus.isLetter           // false
```

## Test for a math symbol

```swift
plus.isMathSymbol       // true
smiley.isMathSymbol     // false
```

## Test for a currency symbol:

```swift
let dollar = "$" as Character
dollar.isCurrencySymbol // true
```

## Punctuation

To test for punctuation marks:

```swift
let qmark = "?" as Character
qmark.isPunctuation     // true
```

## Upper And Lower Case

Properties to test for case and functions to convert the case:

```swift
let b = "b" as Character
let z = "Z" as Character
b.isLowercase           // true
z.isUppercase           // true
```

The functions to convert to upper or lower case return a String as it can result in multiple characters:

```swift
b.uppercased()          // B
pi.uppercased()         // Î 
z.lowercased()          // z

let sharpS = "ÃŸ" as Character
sharpS.uppercased()     // SS
```

The `isCased` property is a strange one. It tests if the character changes when converted to upper or lower case:

```swift
z.isCased               // true (z or Z)
b.isCased               // true (b or B)

let half = "Â½" as Character
half.isCased            // false (always Â½)
```
