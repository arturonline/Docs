# 1.1 Primitives

## Declare and Initialize Primitive types

- Variable must be initialized before use.
- Assignment of one variable to another creates a copy of a value.
- Smaller types are automatically promoted to bigger types.
- Bigger type values cannot be assigned to a smaller type variable.
- Chars must be enclosed in single quotation marks (not double!).

### Example

Each incorrect example given here would cause Java code not to compile:

```java
byte a;
byte b = a;
byte c = 128;
int d = 42L;
float e = 1.2;
char f = "a";
char g = 'AB';
boolean h = "true";
boolean i = 'false';
boolean j = 0;
boolean k = False;
```

## Operators

```java
int a = 1, b = 0;

b = a++; // (b is 1, a is 2) -> b is assigned the value of a first, and then a is incremented
b = ++a; // (b is 3, a is 3) -> a is incremented first and then the result is assigned to b
```
