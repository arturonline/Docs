# Java Concurrency

 A thread is like a separate CPU executing your application. Thus, a multithreaded application is like an application that has multiple CPUs executing different parts of the code at the same time. A thread is not equal to a CPU though. Usually a single CPU will share its execution time among multiple threads, switching between executing each of the threads for a given amount of time. It is also possible to have the threads of an application be executed by different CPUs.
