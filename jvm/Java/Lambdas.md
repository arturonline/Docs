# Java Lambda Expressions

A Java lambda expression is a function which can be created without belonging to any class. A Java lambda expression can be passed around as if it was an object and executed on demand.

## Syntaxis

```java
(parameter list) -> { code block }
```

Other ways to represent a lambda expression:

```java
(parameter) -> expresion // try to avoid parentheses around a single parameter
parameter -> expression

(param p1, param p2) -> expression // try to avoid specifying param types
(param1, param2) -> expression

p -> { code block }

String::toLowerCase; // try to use method references
```

Despite its concise syntax, lambdas should precisely express the functionality they provide. If possible, use one line constructions instead of a large block of code. Remember lambdas should be an expression, not a narrative.

### Method references as Lambdas

In the case where all your lambda expression does is to call another method with the parameters passed to the lambda, the Java lambda implementation provides a shorter way to express the method call.

```java
Consumer<String> myPrinter = s -> System.out.println(s);
Consumer<String> myPrinter = System.out::println;
```

Notice the double colons `::`, these signal to the Java compiler that this is a method reference. The method referenced is what comes after the double colons.

It is possible to reference a constructor of a class. You do that by writing the class name followed by `::new`, like this:

```java
Factory factory = chars -> new String(chars);
Factory factory = String::new;
```

## Type of a Lambda expression

Java is a Typed language. In order to define the type of a lambda expression we use an interface with a single method:

```java
public interface MyFunction {
    public void apply(String s);


MyFunction myFunction = text -> System.out.println(text);
myFunction.apply("hola"),
```

### Functional intefaces

Each lambda corresponds to a given type, specified by a **functional interface**. A functional interface must contain exactly **one abstract method declaration**, with the same number of parameters and the same return type, and each lambda expression of that type will be matched to this abstract method.

âš  Since default methods are not abstract you're free to add default methods to your functional interface.

### Built-in Functional Interfaces

The JDK 1.8 API contains many built-in functional interfaces, which you can find in the package [`java.util.function`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/package-summary.html).

#### Examples

- [`Consumer <T>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Consumer.html)

Represents an operation that accepts a single input argument and returns no result:

```java
Consumer<String> printText = (p) -> System.out.println(p);
printText.accept("hola");
```

- [`Predicate<T>`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/function/Predicate.html)

Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one argument:

```java
Predicate<String> cond = (s)-> s.length() > 5;
System.out.println(cond.test("java2s.com "));
```

## Annotation: `@FunctionalInterface`

To ensure that your interface meet the requirements, you should add the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation. The compiler is aware of this annotation and throws a compiler error as soon as you try to add a second abstract method declaration to the interface.

Example:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface Converter<F, T> {
    T convert(F from);
}

Converter<String, Integer> converter = (from) -> Integer.valueOf(from);
Integer converted = converter.convert("123");
System.out.println(converted);    // 123
```

Keep in mind that the code is also valid if the `@FunctionalInterface` annotation would be ommited.
