# Control Flow

## if Expressions

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 3;

    if number < 5 {
        println!("condition was true");
    } else {
        println!("condition was false");
    }
}
```

Because if is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a let statement:

```rust
fn main() {
    let condition = true;
    let number = if condition {
        5
    } else {
        6
    };

    println!("The value of number is: {}", number);
}
```

## Handling Multiple Conditions with else if

```rust
fn main() {
    let number = 6;

    if number % 4 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 4");
    } else if number % 3 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 3");
    } else if number % 2 == 0 {
        println!("number is divisible by 2");
    } else {
        println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
    }
}
```

## Repeating Code with loop

```rust
fn main() {
    loop {
        println!("again!");
    }
}
```

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop. You can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop executing the loop.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut counter = 0;

    let result = loop {
        counter += 1;

        if counter == 10 {
            break counter * 2;
        }
    };

    println!("The result is {}", result);
}
```

## while

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut number = 3;

    while number != 0 {
        println!("{}!", number);

        number -= 1;
    }

    println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
}
```

## Looping through a collection with for

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];

    for element in a.iter() {
        println!("the value is: {}", element);
    }
}
```
