# Types

Two data type subsets: scalar and compound:

## Scalar types

A scalar type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:

### Integer Types

An integer is a number without a fractional component.

| Length  | Signe | Unsigned |
| ------- | ----- | -------- |
| 8-bit   | i8    | u8       |
| 16-bit  | i16   | u16      |
| 32-bit  | i32   | u32      |
| 64-bit  | i64   | u64      |
| 128-bit | i128  | u128     |
| arch    | isize | usize    |

| Number literals | Example     |
| --------------- | ----------- |
| Decimal         | 98_222      |
| Hex             | 0xff        |
| Octal           | 0o77        |
| Binary          | 0b1111_0000 |
| Byte (u8 only)  | b'A'        |

So how do you know which type of integer to use? If youâ€™re unsure, Rustâ€™s defaults are generally good choices, and integer types default to `i32`: this type is generally the fastest, even on 64-bit systems. The primary situation in which youâ€™d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing some sort of collection.

### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for floating-point numbers, which are numbers with decimal points. Rustâ€™s floating-point types are f32 and f64, which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is f64 because on modern CPUs itâ€™s roughly the same speed as f32 but is capable of more precision.

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 2.0; // f64

    let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
}
```

### Booleans

```rust
fn main() {
    let t = true;

    let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
}
```

### The Character Type

Rustâ€™s char type is four bytes in size and represents a Unicode Scalar Value, which means it can represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters; emoji; and zero-width spaces are all valid char values in Rust.

```rust
fn main() {
  let c = 'z';
  let z = 'â„¤';
  let heart_eyed_cat = 'ðŸ˜»';
}
```

## Compound types

### Tuple Type

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
}
```

To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let (x, y, z) = tup;
    println!("The value of y is: {}", y);
}
```

In addition to destructuring through pattern matching, we can access a tuple element directly by using a period (.) followed by the index of the value we want to access:

```rust
fn main() {
    let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    let five_hundred = x.0;
    let six_point_four = x.1;
    let one = x.2;
}
```

### Array Type

Unlike a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Arrays in Rust are different from arrays in some other languages because arrays in Rust have a fixed length, like tuples.

```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
}
```

You would write an arrayâ€™s type like so:

```rust
let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
```

for initializing an array hat contains the same value for each element:

```rust
let a = [3; 5]; // a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];
```
