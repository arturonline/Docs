# Impact

All PowerShell cmdlets that modify the system in some fashion are supposed to support the `-confirm` parameter. When run with `-confirm` (or `-whatif`, which is supported if `-confirm` is), the cmdlet will ask you to verify each action it takes. For example:

```powershell
Get-Process | Stop-Process -confirm
```

Any cmdlet that declares support for `-confirm` also declares its confirm impact. That impact is simply "**Low**", "**Medium**" or "**High**," based on the cmdlet author's perception of how potentially deadly the cmdlet is. The shell also has a built-in `$ConfirmPreference` variable, which by default is set to "**High**". Here's how it works: If you run a cmdlet whose impact is equal to or higher than `$ConfirmPreference`, then confirmation happens automatically, whether you specify the `-confirm` parameter or not.

Suppose you run across a cmdlet that automatically confirms (`Set-ExecutionPolicy` and `Enable-PSRemoting` are two examples), but you want to suppress the confirmation? Just do this:

```powershell
Enable-PSRemoting -confirm:$false
```

That shuts off the automatic confirmation, allowing the cmdlet to run without asking you if you're sure. Be careful!

## Example in a custom Cmdlet

```powershell
Function set-stuff{
    [cmdletbinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$true,
                    confirmImpact='Medium')]
    param(
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        [string]$computername
    )
    Process{

        If ($psCmdlet.shouldProcess("$Computername")){
            Write-Output 'Im changing something right now'
        }
    }
}
```

## A better example

```powershell
function Set-VolLabel
{
    [CmdletBinding(SupportsShouldProcess=$true, ConfirmImpact='Medium')]
    Param
    (
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        [String]$ComputerName,
        [Parameter(Mandatory=$True)]
        [String]$Label
    )
    Process
    {
        if ($pscmdlet.ShouldProcess("$ComputerName - label change to $Label"))
        {
            $VolName=Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter "DeviceID='c:'" -ComputerName $ComputerName
            $VolName.VolumeName ="$Label"
            $VolName.Put() | Out-Null
        }
    }
}
```
