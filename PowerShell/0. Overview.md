# Intro

Windows PowerShell is Microsoft's task automation framework, consisting of a command-line shell and associated scripting language built on top of .NET Framework. PowerShell provides full access to COM and WMI, enabling administrators to perform administrative tasks on both local and remote Windows systems.

PowerShell commands are called **Cmdlets**. This Cmdlets are .NET Framework class objects; and not just stand-alone executables. Cmdlets process works on objects not on text stream and objects can be passed as output for pipelining.

## How to use it

PowerShell introduces over a hundred commands, and that is a lot to learn. However, it includes a comprehensive help system that can help you find commands to accomplish tasks, and it explains how to use those commands.

## cmdlets

Cmdlets are organized in the form of a verb-noun string. Once you understand this template, you can practically guess the meaning of any cmdlet.

* `Get` — To get something
* `Set` — To define something
* `Start` — To run something
* `Stop` — To stop something that is running
* `Out` — To output something
* `New` — To create something (“new” is not a verb, of course, but it functions as one)
