## Enable Powershell remoting on the PC you want to access remotely

While PowerShell Remoting works out of the box with Windows Server 2012/2016, that is not the case with earlier versions. You have to enable `WinRm` on all older operating systems.

To enable PowerShell Remoting:

- Open PowerShell as Adminitrator.
- In the PowerShell window, type:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting -Force
    ```

    This command starts the `WinRM service`, sets it to start automatically with your system, and creates a firewall rule that allows incoming connections. The `-Force` part of the cmdlet tells PowerShell to perform these actions without prompting you for each step.

### Test de Connection

```powershell
PS C:\> Test-WsMan COMPUTER

# replacing “COMPUTER” with the name or IP address of the remote PC
```

## Invoke-command

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs commands on a local or remote computer and returns all output from the commands, including errors.

>💡 Use `Invoke-Command` if you’re only going to run one command against a system.

- One to one:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -FilePath c:\scripts\test.ps1 -ComputerName Server01

    # This command runs the Test.ps1 script on the Server01 computer.
    ```

- One to many:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName server01 -Credential domain01\user01 -ScriptBlock {Get-Culture}

    # This command runs a Get-Culture command on the Server01 remote computer.
    ```

    >💡 `Invoke-Command` has an alias: `icm`

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> icm server01, server02 { get-eventlog -LogName system -new 3}
    ```

## Establishing an Interactive Powershell console on a remote system

An interactive PowerShell console can be obtained on a remote system using the `Enter-PSSession` command.

>💡 Use `Enter-PSSession` if you want to interact with a single system

```powershell
Enter-PSSession –ComputerName server1.domain.com
```

If you want out of the PowerShell session the `Exit-PSSession` command can be used.

```powershell
Exit-PSSession
```

## Sessions

`New-PSSession` allows users to create background sessions. Background sessions can come in handy if you want to execute multiple commands against many systems.

>💡 Use PowerShell `New-PSSession` to create a persistent session on a remote computer.

```powershell
PS C:\> $sessions=New-PSSession -ComputerName server01

# Now we close the window

PS C:\> icm server01 {$var=2}
PS C:\> icm -Session $sessions {$var}

# 2
```

When using `New-PSSession` remember that you have to enter each session.

```powershell
New-PSSession -ComputerName server01
# The output will show you a Session ID

Enter-PSSession -Id 5
```

>💡 To check the state of a session:`Get-PSSession`

### Removing Background Sessions

Finally, to remove all of your active sessions the `Disconnect-PsSession` command can be used as shown below.

```powershell
Get-PSSession | Disconnect-PSSession
```
