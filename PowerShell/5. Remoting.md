# Remoting

PowerShell Remoting lets you run PowerShell commands or access full PowerShell sessions on remote Windows systems. It’s similar to SSH for accessing remote terminals on other operating systems.

## Enable Powershell remoting on the PC you want to access remotely

PowerShell is locked-down by default, so you’ll have to enable PowerShell Remoting before using it:

- Open PowerShell as Adminitrator (Windows+X in win10).
- In the PowerShell window, type:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Enable-PSRemoting -Force
    ```

    This command starts the WinRM service, sets it to start automatically with your system, and creates a firewall rule that allows incoming connections. The `-Force` part of the cmdlet tells PowerShell to perform these actions without prompting you for each step.

If your computers aren’t on a domain, you need to perform a few more steps to get things set up.

Configure the `TrustedHosts` setting on both the PC to which you want to connect and the PC (or PCs) you want to connect from, so the computers will trust each other.

- If you’re on a home network where you want to go ahead and trust any PC to connect remotely, you can type the following cmdlet in PowerShell (again, you’ll need to run it as Administrator).

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Set-Item wsman:\localhost\client\trustedhosts *
    PS C:\> Restart-Service WinRM
    ```

- If instead you want to restrict computers that can connect, you can replace the asterisk with a comma-separated list of IP addresses or computer names for approved PCs.

### Test de Connection

```powershell
PS C:\> Test-WsMan COMPUTER

# replacing “COMPUTER” with the name or IP address of the remote PC
```

## Invoke-command

The `Invoke-Command` cmdlet runs commands on a local or remote computer and returns all output from the commands, including errors. By using a single `Invoke-Command`, you can run commands on multiple computers.

- One to one:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -FilePath c:\scripts\test.ps1 -ComputerName Server01

    # This command runs the Test.ps1 script on the Server01 computer.
    ```

- One to many:

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> Invoke-Command -ComputerName server01 -Credential domain01\user01 -ScriptBlock {Get-Culture}

    # This command runs a Get-Culture command on the Server01 remote computer.
    ```

    >💡 `Invoke-Command` has an alias: `icm`

    ```powershell
    PS C:\> icm server01, server02 { get-eventlog -LogName system -new 3}
    ```
