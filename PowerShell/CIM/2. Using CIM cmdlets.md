# Using CIM cmdlets

## Discoverability

```powershell
# Using tab completion for CIM cmdlet parameters ( Tab+Space in ISE shows a drop down)

Get-CimInstance â€“Namespace <Tab> #Finding top-level namespaces

# Tab completion for class names

# If namespace is not specified, shows classes from default root/cimv2 namespace

Get-CimInstance -ClassName *Bios<Tab>

Get-CimInstance â€“Namespace root/Microsoft/Windows/smb â€“ClassName <tab>

# Note: Tab completion only works for local machine.

#Using Get-CimClass for advanced class search

#All classes in root/cimv2

PS:>Get-CimClass

#Classes named like disk

PS:>Get-CimClass -ClassName *disk*

# The Cmdlet makes querying much easier (what would require scripting before)

# Get all classes starting with "Win32" that have method starting with "Term"

PS:>Get-CimClass Win32* -MethodName Term*

# Get classes starting with "Win32" that have a property named "Handle"

PS:>Get-CimClass Win32* -PropertyName Handle

# Get classes starting with "Win32" that have the "Association" qualifier

PS:>Get-CimClass Win32* -QualifierName Association

#Find classes used for events

PS:> Get-CimClass -Namespace root/Microsoft/Windows/smb -class *Smb* -QualifierName Indication
```

>âš  `Get-CimClass` and tab completion described above only works for local machine. If you specify ComputerName or CimSession parameter, tab completion would not work.

## Getting Instances

Getting/Enumerating instance of a class is the most commonly performed operation.

1. The `Get-CimInstance` cmdlet returns one or more instances of `CimInstance`. `CimInstance` is different from the object returned by `Get-WmiObject`.
2. `_Properties` are no longer mixed with `properties of an instance`.
3. Allow retrieval of key properties.
4. Allow creation of in-memory instance to reduce round trips.
5. Allow retrieval of specific instances using in-memory instances or actual instances.
6. `DateTime` values are returned as objects of `System.DateTime` type. Old cmdlets treat them as strings.

```powershell
# Get-CimInstance was designed to be similar to the Get-WmiObject

# WMI Cmdlet : Get-WmiObject -class Win32_Process

# WsMan Cmdlet : get-wsmaninstance wmicimv2/win32_process -Enumerate

# The default value of -Namespace is root/cimv2, and the default value of -ComputerName is local computer

PS:> Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Process

# Filtering using WQL

PS:> Get-CimInstance -Query "SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE Name Like â€˜power%â€™"

# use the -Filter parameter with -classname

PS:> Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Process -Filter "Name Like â€˜power%â€™"

#Retrieving a subset of properties : To reduce memory and on-the-wire footprint

PS:> Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Process -Property Name, Handle

#Only get the key properties

PS:> Get-CimInstance -Class Win32_Process -KeyOnly

########################## Looking into CimInstance #########################

PS:>  $x, $y = Get-CimInstance Win32_Process

PS:>  $x | gm

# The object contains the full CIM class derivation hierarchy

PS:> $x.pstypenames

# The object also has a reference to its class declaration

PS:> $x.CimClass | gm

# DateTime values are returned as strings

PS:> Get-WmiObject Win32_OperatingSystem | Select *Time*

# DateTime values are returned as System.DateTime

PS:> Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem | Select *Time*#
```

## Working with associations

Customers wanted a way to find out associated instances of a particular instance. To resolve this issue we came up with a cmdlet called `Get-CimAssociatedInstance`.

```powershell

# Get instance of Win32_LogicalDisk class with DriveType =3 (hard drives)

PS:> $disk1, $diskn = Get-CimInstance -class Win32_LogicalDisk -Filter â€˜DriveType = 3â€™

PS:> $disk1

# Get the all instances associated with this disk

PS:> Get-CimAssociatedInstance -CimInstance $disk1

# Get instances of a specific type

PS:> Get-CimAssociatedInstance -CimInstance $disk1 -ResultClassName Win32_DiskPartition

# Finding associated instances through a specific CIM relationship

PS:> Get-CimAssociatedInstance -CimInstance $diskn -Association Win32_LogicalDiskRootDirectory
```

## Working with methods

A large number of tasks in WMI are achieved by invoking methods. The new `Invoke-CimMethod` makes two things really easy:

a. Discovery of method and method parameters
b. Execution of methods with parameters. Using feedback from our customers: Connect bug

```powershell
PS:> $class = Get-CimClass Win32_Process

PS:> $class.CimClassMethods

# Get the parameters of the Create method

PS:> $class.CimClassMethods["Create"].Parameters

# Invoke the static Create method on the Win32_Process class to create an instance of the Notepad

# application. Notice that the method parameters are given in a hash table since CIM method arguments

# are unordered by definition.

PS:> Invoke-CimMethod -Class win32_process -MethodName Create -Argument @{CommandLine=â€™notepad.exeâ€™;

CurrentDirectory = "c:\windows\system32"}

# Get the owners of the running Notepad instances

PS:> $result = Invoke-CimMethod -Query â€˜SELECT * FROM Win32_Process WHERE name like "notepad%"â€™

-MethodName GetOwner

# The result has the returned value and out parameters of the method

PS:> $result
```

## CliXML serialization

`CimInstance` supports full fidelity `serialization` and `deserialization`. This is an important feature for those who wish to save state of an instance or result of a cmdlet and then want to use it later. The WMI cmdlets do not support full-fidelity `serialization/deserialization`.

```powershell
# CimInstances are serialized and deserialized with full fidelity

PS:> $x = Get-CimInstance Win32_Service

PS:> $x

PS:> $x[0].pstypenames

PS:> $x | Export-CliXml t1.xml

PS:> $y = Import-CliXml .\t1.xml

PS:> $y

PS:> $y[0].pstypenames

# The deserialized objects are identical to the ones obtained from the server

PS:> diff ($y) (Get-CimInstance win32_service )
```

## Remote management

Managing remote machines with the new cmdlets is also pretty simple and straight forward. The two parameters that can be used to manage remote machines are:

a. `ComputerName`
b. `CimSession`

```powershell
PS:> $props = @{v_Key = [UInt64] 8;}

# If ComputerName parameter is used, the cmdlets create an implicit session during the execution.

PS:> $inst = New-CimInstance -ClassName TestClass -Namespace root\test -Key v_Key -Property $props

-ComputerName SecondWin8Server

# Create a session

PS:> $session = New-CimSession â€“ComputerName SecondWin8Server

# Use the session

PS:> $inst = New-CimInstance -ClassName TestClass -Namespace root\test -Key v_Key -Property $props

â€“CimSession $session
```

>ðŸ’¡ If a large number of remote operations are to be performed then session reuse is highly recommended. This can provide a significant performance gain.
