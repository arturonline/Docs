# Overview

## CIM

The Common Information Model (CIM, pronounced sim) is a DMTF specification that describes computer hardware and software components. CIM is part of a larger systems-management framework called Web-Based Enterprise Management (WBEM).

Every Windows server or client computer has a local CIM repository. As systems administrators, we can tap into that CIM repository to fetch and set properties and take action on the repository data.

Although it's a long-time DMTF member, a while back Microsoft made the ill-advised decision to write its own abstraction layer on top of CIM, called Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).

## WMI

WMI is Microsoft's implementation of CIM. Microsoft also created the WMI Query Language (WQL) to give admins a method that works like Structured Query Language (SQL) for accessing CIM object data. If you don't yet know SQL, I'd encourage you to learn it, because you can apply that syntax in WQL to query system configuration data.

## CIM cmdlets

Microsoft has since deprecated the WMI commands in Windows in favor of their CIM counterparts.
