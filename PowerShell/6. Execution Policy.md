# Execution policy

Microsoft has disabled scripting by default in an effort to prevent malicious code from executing in a PowerShell environment.

There is four levels of security available:

* **Restricted** — Restricted is the default execution policy and locks PowerShell down so that commands can be entered only interactively. PowerShell scripts are not allowed to run.
* **All Signed** — If the execution policy is set to All Signed then scripts will be allowed to run, but only if they are signed by a trusted publisher.
* **Remote Signed** — If the execution policy is set to Remote Signed, any PowerShell scripts that have been locally created will be allowed to run. Scripts created remotely are allowed to run only if they are signed by a trusted publisher.
* **Unrestricted** — As the name implies, Unrestricted removes all restrictions from the execution policy.

You can control the level of security surrounding PowerShell scripts.

## Set Execution Policy

```powershell
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy "Unrestricted"
PS C:\> Set-ExecutionPolicy "remotesigned"
