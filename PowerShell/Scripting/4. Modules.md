## How to Create A PowerShell Module

Save the file with a `.PSM1` extension.

## How to Use A PowerShell Module

Just import it:

```powershell
# Importing script.psm1

Import-Module \\Server\Files\script.psm1
```

## PSModule Path

Whenever you run `Import-Module`, it only loads the module in the current session. You must either load the module again or, preferably, place the module into the PowerShell path so that it auto-loads the next time.

To Show the Powershell path:

```powershell
$env:PSModulePath -split ";"
```

>ðŸ’¡ Best place to save your modules is `C:\Users\artur\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Modules`

### Folders

To place our module into its own folder, the convention here is that the name of the folder matches the name of the `.psm1` file:

```powershell
Scripts
â”‚   myscript.ps1
â”‚
â””â”€â”€â”€GetInfo
        GetInfo.psm1
```

## Dot sourcing

Ordinarily when a script is executed it can be run as

```powershell
.\script.ps1
```

This creates a child scope for the script however once the script completes any objects create are discarded, for example any variables created.

Alternatively you can dot source the script which will run in the current scope which means any variables etc will be maintained post script execution, e.g.

```powershell
. .\script.ps1
```

You can easily test this. Save the following as script.ps1:

```powershell
$answer="42"
write-output "ultimate answer is $answer"
```

Now see example execution:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> .\script.ps1
ultimate answer is 42

PS D:\temp> $answer

PS D:\temp> . .\script.ps1
ultimate answer is 42

PS D:\temp> $answer
42
```
