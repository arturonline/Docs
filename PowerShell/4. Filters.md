# Filters

## The `$_,` symbol

`$_,` represents the output of a previous cmdlet that is being piped into a new cmdlet.

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Path S:\ -Recurse | Where-Object {$_.LastWriteTime -gt "05/12/2015"}
```

## Where-object

The `Where-Object` filters objects passed down the pipeline based on the search criteria you specify in a script block included with the cmdlet. In other words, the script block determines which objects are permitted to continue down the pipeline and which are not.

>`Where-Object` has two alias: `where` and `?`

Example:

```powershell
# PowerShell Where-Object filter to list the exe files C:\program Files
GCI "C:\Program Files" -recurse | Where-Object {$_.extension -eq ".exe"}
```

Because the `Where-Object` command is applied to every object as it passes down the pipeline, the `$_` symbol makes it possible to associate the specified property with each object, without having to know the number of objects being passed down the pipeline and without needing to differentiate between those objects.

PowerShell has aliases for the common cmdlets; `?` and `Where` are aliases for `Where-Object`, you may already know gci for `Get-ChildItem`.

```powershell
# PowerShell Where script to list exe files C:\Program Files

$GuyDir = "C:\Program Files"
$FilesExe = Get-ChildItem $GuyDir -recurse
$List = $FilesExe | ? {$_.extension -eq ".exe"}
$List | Sort-Object -unique | Format-Table name
```

### Comparison operators

- -ne (not equal to)
- -lt (less than)
- -le (less than or equal to)
- -gt (greater than)
- -ge (greater than or equal to)
- -like (like—a wildcard comparison)
- -notlike (not like—a wildcard comparison)
- -contains (contains the specified value)
- -notcontains (doesn't contain the specified value)

## Select-Object

The `Select-Object` cmdlet selects specified properties of an object or set of objects. It can also select unique objects, a specified number of objects, or objects in a specified position in an array.

>`Select-Object` has an alias: `select`

For example, suppose you want to view the DisplayName and Status properties of the *Background Intelligent Transfer Service* (BITS) on your machine. You can use the `Get-Service` cmdlet to get the information for BITS and pipe the results to `Select-Object` with those properties specified, like this:

```powershell
Get-Service bits | Select -Property DisplayName,Status
```

More examples:

```powershell
Get-Process | Select-Object -Property ProcessName, CPU | Format-List
```

```powershell
Get-Process | select ProcessName, CPU | where CPU -gt 10 | Format-List
```
