# Directives

A directive typically changes the way a view is parsed or enables different functionality. Razor directives are represented by implicit expressions with reserved keywords following the @ symbol.

## @using

```csharp
@using System.IO
@{
    var dir = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory();
}
<p>@dir</p>
```

## @model

The `@model` directive specifies the type of the model passed to a view.

```csharp
@model TypeNameOfModel
```

The value of the model is passed from the controller to the view.

```csharp
<div>The Login Email: @Model.Email</div>
```

## @inherits

The  default base class for a Razor view in ASP.NET MVC is `WebViewPage<T>`, , and in most cases you don't need to fiddle with @inherits  - it's more common to use the @model directive and just strongly type the default base class with a specific ViewModel type.

## @inject

The `@inject` directive enables the Razor Page to inject a service from the service container into a view.

## @functions

The `@functions` directive enables a Razor Page to add a C# code block to a view:

```csharp
@functions { // C# Code }
```

For example:

```csharp
@functions {
    public string GetHello()
    {
        return "Hello";
    }
}

<div>From method: @GetHello()</div>

// <div>From method: Hello</div>
```

The following code is generated:

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.Razor;

public class _Views_Home_Test_cshtml : RazorPage<dynamic>
{
    // Functions placed between here
    public string GetHello()
    {
        return "Hello";
    }
    // And here.
#pragma warning disable 1998
    public override async Task ExecuteAsync()
    {
        WriteLiteral("\r\n<div>From method: ");
        Write(GetHello());
        WriteLiteral("</div>\r\n");
    }
#pragma warning restore 1998
```

## @section

The `@section` directive is used in conjunction with the layout to enable views to render content in different parts of the HTML page.
