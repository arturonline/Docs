# Tables

Colons can be used to align columns.

```markdown
| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
```

- There must be at least 3 dashes separating each header cell.
- The outer pipes (|) are optional.
- You don't need to make the raw Markdown line up prettily.
- You can also use inline Markdown.

```markdown
Markdown | Less | Pretty
--- | --- | ---
*Still* | `renders` | **nicely**
1 | 2 | 3
```
