# Creating an Assembly

You can create assemblies by compiling the project using command-line compilers.

>Visual Studio for C# and Visual Basic can be used only to create single-file assemblies. If you want to create multifile assemblies, you must use command-line compilers or Visual C++.

## Single-File assembly

We have several options:

```csharp
// The following example creates an assembly named myCode.exe from a code module called myCode.
csc myCode.cs

// The following example creates an assembly named myAssembly.exe from a code module called myCode.
csc -out:myAssembly.exe myCode.cs

// The following example creates a library assembly named myCodeAssembly.dll from a code module called myCode.
csc -out:myCodeLibrary.dll -t:library myCode.cs
```

## Multifile Assemblies

**Step #1**: Compile all files that contain namespaces referenced by other modules in the assembly into code modules:

```csharp
csc /t:module Stringer.cs

//Specifying the module parameter with the /t: compiler option indicates that the file should be compiled as a module rather than as an assembly. The compiler produces a module called Stringer.netmodule, which can be added to an assembly.
```

**Step #2**: Compile all other modules, using the necessary compiler options to indicate the other modules that are referenced in the code. This step uses the `/addmodule` compiler option.

```csharp
csc /addmodule:Stringer.netmodule /t:module Client.cs

// Specify the /t:module option because this module will be added to an assembly in a future step. Specify the /addmodule option because the code in Client references a namespace created by the code in Stringer.netmodule. The compiler produces a module called Client.netmodule that contains a reference to another module, Stringer.netmodule.
```

**Step #3**: Use the Assembly Linker (**Al.exe**) to create the output file that contains the assembly manifest. This file contains reference information for all modules or resources that are part of the assembly.

At the command prompt, type the following command:

```csharp
al <module name> <module name> â€¦ /main:<method name> /out:<file name> /target:<assembly file type>

// In this command, the module name arguments specify the name of each module to include in the assembly. The /main: option specifies the method name that is the assembly's entry point. The /out: option specifies the name of the output file, which contains assembly metadata. The /target: option specifies that the assembly is a console application executable (.exe) file, a Windows executable (.win) file, or a library (.lib) file.
```

In the following example, Al.exe creates an assembly that is a console application executable called myAssembly.exe. The application consists of two modules called `Client.netmodule` and `Stringer.netmodule`, and the executable file called `myAssembly.exe`, which contains only assembly metadata. The entry point of the assembly is the Main method in the class `MainClientApp`, which is located in `Client.dll`.

```csharp
al Client.netmodule Stringer.netmodule /main:MainClientApp.Main /out:myAssembly.exe /target:exe
```

Once you create the assembly, you can sign the file that contains the assembly manifest (and hence the assembly), or you can give the file (and the assembly) a strong name and put it in the global assembly cache.
