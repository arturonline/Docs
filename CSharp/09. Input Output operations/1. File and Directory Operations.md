# File and Directory Operations

`System.IO` namespace is a collection of the base classes devoted to file-based and memory-based input and output services for .net.

The `System.IO` namespace provides a set of Classes for performing file and directory operations, such as copying and moving, creating directories, and setting file attributes and permissions.

| Class Name    | Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| File          | File is a static class that provides different functionalities like copy, create, move, delete, open for reading or /writing, encrypt or decrypt, check if a file exists, append lines or text to a file’s content, get last access time, etc. |
| FileInfo      | The FileInfo class provides the same functionality as a static File class. You have more control on how you do read/write operations on a file by writing code manually for reading or writing bytes from a file.                               |
| Directory     | Directory is a static class that provides functionality for creating, moving, deleting and accessing subdirectories.                                                                                                                            |
| DirectoryInfo | DirectoryInfo provides instance methods for creating, moving, deleting and accessing subdirectories.                                                                                                                                            |
| Path          | Path is a static class that provides functionality such as retrieving the extension of a file, changing the extension of a file, retrieving the absolute physical path, and other path related functionalities.                                 |

Static classes:

* `File`
* `Directory`

Instance method classes (constructed with a file or directory name)

* `FileInfo`
* `DirectoryInfo`

Additionally, there’s a static class called `Path`. This provides string manipulation methods for filenames and directory paths.

## Working with directories

A drive contains a list of directories and files. To work with them, `DirectoryInfo` or `Directory` are used. To work with those items, you can use the `DirectoryInfo` object or the static `Directory` class. Both classes offer access to your folder structure. When executing only a single operation against your file system, it can be more effcient to use the static `Directory` class. When you want to execute multiple operations against a folder, `DirectoryInfo` is a better choice.

### Create a Directory

You just need to give a full path along with a folder name where you want to create the folder as a parameter in the method. A new directory or folder with the name *"Directory Folder"* will be created. (when the path is not given, then by default the folder will be created in the current directory where you are working).

```csharp
var directory = Directory.CreateDirectory(@"C:\Temp\ProgrammingInCSharp\Directory");

var directoryInfo = new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\Temp\ProgrammingInCSharp\DirectoryInfo");
directoryInfo.Create();
```

As you can see, a DirectoryInfo object can be initialized with a non-existing folder.
When you create a new folder, you automatically have both read and write rights to the folder.
After creating the folder, you can call other instance members on the DirectoryInfo object that now points to the newly created folder.

#### Checking the existence of specific directory

```csharp
if (Directory.Exists(@"C:\Temp\ProgrammingInCSharp\Directory"))
{
    Directory.Delete(@"C:\Temp\ProgrammingInCSharp\Directory");
}

var directoryInfo = new DirectoryInfo(@"C:\Temp\ProgrammingInCSharp\DirectoryInfo");

if (directoryInfo.Exists)
{
    directoryInfo.Delete();
}
```

### Move directory from one location to another

`Move()` method is used with Directory Class (Static class), whereas `MoveTo()` method is used with DirectoryInfo Class. `Move()` method requires you to know the source directory path and the destination directory path, whereas the `MoveTo()` method just requires the destination directory path because the DirectoryInfo's object already constrains the reference of the source directory path.

```csharp
//Using Directory Class
Directory.Move("Directory Folder", "../Moved Directory Folder");

//Using DirectoryInfo Class
directoryInfo.MoveTo("../Moved DirectoryInfo Folder");
```

## Working with files

Directories are necessary only to give some structure to the files they need to store. Just as with directories, you can use both a static `File` class and a `FileInfo` object to access files. You can determine whether a file exists and when it does, you can take action, such as deleting it.

```csharp
string path = @"c:\temp\test.txt";

if (File.Exists(path))
{
    File.Delete(path);
}

FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(path);
if (fileInfo.Exists)
{
    fileInfo.Delete();
}
```

You can also move files around by using the `File.Move(string source, string destination)` or
`FileInfo.MoveTo(string destination)`. Moving a fle deletes the original if the move is successful. If that’s not what you want, you can also use Copy and CopyTo.

```csharp
string path = @"c:\temp\test.txt";
string destPath = @"c:\temp\destTest.txt";

File.CreateText(path).Close();
File.Move(path, destPath);

FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(path);
fileInfo.MoveTo(destPath);

string path = @"c:\temp\test.txt";
string destPath = @"c:\temp\destTest.txt";

File.CreateText(path).Close();
File.Copy(path, destPath);

FileInfo fileInfo = new FileInfo(path);
fileInfo.CopyTo(destPath);
```

## Working with paths

When accessing fles, you often have a need for combining a directory and a file name.
Manually concatenating them by using simple string addition can work, but it is error-prone. The static class `Path` that can be found in `System.IO` has some helper methods for dealing with paths:

```csharp
string folder = @"C:\temp";
string fileName = "test.dat";

string fullPath = Path.Combine(folder, fileName); // Results in C:\\temp\\test.dat
```

```csharp
string path = @"C:\temp\subdir\file.txt";

Console.WriteLine(Path.GetDirectoryName(path)); // Displays C:\temp\subdir
Console.WriteLine(Path.GetExtension(path)); // Displays .txt
Console.WriteLine(Path.GetFileName(path)); // Displays file.txt
Console.WriteLine(Path.GetPathRoot(path)); // Displays C:\
```

## Drive

When working with the file system, you obviously start with a storage medium (hard drive, CD player...). The .NET Framework offers the `DriveInfo` class to access the drives on your computer. A `DriveInfo` object doesn’t have any specifc methods for dealing with drives but it does have several properties to access information such as the name of the drive, size, and available free space.

```csharp
//Get the Drive
DriveInfo info = new DriveInfo(@"C:\");
Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + info.Name);
Console.WriteLine("Drive Type is: " + info.DriveType);
```

```csharp
//Get the all the drive
DriveInfo[] driveInfo = DriveInfo.GetDrives();
foreach (var info in driveInfo)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + info.Name);
    Console.WriteLine("Drive Type is: " + info.DriveType);
    Console.WriteLine("********************");
}
```
