# Validate application input

When invalid data enters your application, it can be that your application crashes.

Avoiding these types of problems is the area of managing data integrity. There are four different types of data integrity:

- _Entity integrity_ States that each entity (a record in a database) should be uniquely identifiable. In a database, this is achieved by using a primary key column. A primary key uniquely identifies each row of data. It can be generated by the database or by your application.
- _Domain integrity_ Refers to the validity of the data that an entity contains. This can be about the type of data and the possible values that are allowed (a valid postal code, a number within a certain range, or a default value, for example).
- _Referential integrity_ The relationship that entities have with each other, such as the relationship between an order and a customer.
- _User-defined integrity_ Comprises specific business rules that you need to enforce. A business rule for a web shop might involve a new customer who is not allowed to place an order above a certain dollar amount.
