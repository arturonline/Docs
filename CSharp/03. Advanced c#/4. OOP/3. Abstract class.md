# Abstract class

The purpose of an abstract class is to provide a common definition of a base class that multiple derived classes can share.

* An abstract class cannot be instantiated.
* abstract classes may contain state (data members) and/or implementation (methods)
* abstract classes can be inherited without implementing the abstract methods (though such a derived class is abstract itself)
* An abstract class may contain abstract methods and accessors.
* It is not possible to modify an abstract class with the sealed modifier (the sealed modifier prevents a class from being inherited).
* A derived class from an abstract class must implement all abstract methods and abstract accessors.
* Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes.
* It is an error to use the static or virtual modifiers in an abstract method or property declaration.

```csharp
abstract class Vehicle
{
    protected int wheels;
    public int Wheels
    {
        get { return wheels; }
    }
}

class Bike : Vehicle
{
    public Bike()
    {
        base.wheels = 2;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Vehicle vehicle = new Bike();
        Console.WriteLine(vehicle.Wheels);
    }
}
```

## Abstract methods

An Abstract method is a method without a body. Abstract method declarations are only permitted in abstract classes. The implementation of an abstract method is done by a derived class. When the derived class inherits the abstract method from the abstract class, it must override the abstract method.

```csharp
public abstract class A
{
    public abstract void DoWork(int i);
}
```

In this example, the class DerivedClass is derived from an abstract class BaseClass. The abstract class contains an abstract method, AbstractMethod, and two abstract properties, X and Y.

```csharp

abstract class BaseClass   // Abstract class
{
    protected int _x = 100;
    protected int _y = 150;
    public abstract void AbstractMethod();   // Abstract method
    public abstract int X    { get; }
    public abstract int Y    { get; }
}

class DerivedClass : BaseClass
{
    public override void AbstractMethod()
    {
        _x++;
        _y++;
    }

    public override int X   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _x + 10;
        }
    }

    public override int Y   // overriding property
    {
        get
        {
            return _y + 10;
        }
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        DerivedClass o = new DerivedClass();
        o.AbstractMethod();
        Console.WriteLine("x = {0}, y = {1}", o.X, o.Y);
    }
}
// Output: x = 111, y = 161
```

## Abstract properties

An abstract property declaration does not provide an implementation of the property accessors -- it declares that the class supports properties, but leaves the accessor implementation to derived classes.

```csharp
//Abstract Class with abstract properties
abstract class absClass
{
    protected int myNumber;
    public abstract int numbers
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}

class absDerived:absClass
{
    //Implementing abstract properties
    public override int numbers
    {
        get
        {
            return myNumber;
        }
        set
        {
            myNumber = value;
        }
    }
}
```
