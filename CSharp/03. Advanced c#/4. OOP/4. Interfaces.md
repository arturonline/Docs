# Interfaces

* An interface contains only the signatures of methods, properties, events or indexers, Interfaces contain no implementation of methods.
* A class or struct that implements the interface must implement the members of the interface that are specified in the interface definition.
* Properties and indexers of a class can define extra accessors for a property or indexer that's defined in an interface. For example, an interface might declare a property that has a get accessor. The class that implements the interface can declare the same property with both a get and set accessor.
* Interface members are automatically public, and they can't include any access modifiers. Members also can't be static.
* Interfaces can implement other Interfaces.
* An interface can't be instantiated directly.

Example:

```csharp
interface ISampleInterface
{
    void SampleMethod();
}

class ImplementationClass : ISampleInterface
{
    // Explicit interface member implementation:
    void ISampleInterface.SampleMethod()
    {
        // Method implementation.
    }

    static void Main()
    {
        // Declare an interface instance.
        ISampleInterface obj = new ImplementationClass();

        // Call the member.
        obj.SampleMethod();
    }
}
```

In C#, class can implement interface by two ways:

1. Implement interface implicitly
2. Implement interface explicitly

## Implement interface implicitly

Implicit interfaces are implemented publicly. It is implemented when explicit definition of each interface’s members isn’t required.

```csharp
interface IVehicle
{
    int Wheels { get; }
}

class Bike : IVehicle
{
    private int wheels;
    public int Wheels
    {
        get
        {
            return wheels;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IVehicle vehicle = new Bike();
        Console.WriteLine(vehicle.Wheels);
    }
}
```

## Implement interface explicitly

When a class implements more than one interface which share a common member’s name, explicit implementation of interface is required to separate the definition of each member.

```csharp
interface IEnglish
{
    int Marks { get; }
}

interface IMath
{
    int Marks { get; }
}

class Student : IEnglish, IMath
{
    int english = 10;
    int math = 9;

    int IMath.Marks
    {
        get
        {
            return english;
        }
    }

    int IEnglish.Marks
    {
        get
        {
            return math;
        }
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Student std = new Student();

        int english = ((IEnglish)std).Marks;
        int math = ((IMath)std).Marks;

        Console.WriteLine("English Marks = {0} Math Marks = {1}",
        english, math);
    }
}
```
