# Encapsulation

Encapsulation is implemented through two ways:

1. Access Specifiers
2. Data Protection

## 1. Access Specifiers

| C# Modifier        | Definition                                                                                                         |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| public             | The type or member can be accessed by any other code in the same assembly or another assembly that references it.  |
| private            | The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class.                                                 |
| protected          | The type or member can only be accessed by code in the same class or in a derived class.                           |
| internal           | The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, but not from another assembly.                |
| protected internal | The type or member can be accessed by any code in the same assembly, or by any derived class in another assembly. (keep in mind that it is or, not and)  |
| private protected  | The type or member can be accessed by code in the same class or in a derived class within the base class assembly. |

The access modifer of the enclosing type is always taken into account. For example, a public method inside an internal class has an accessibility of internal. There are exceptions to this (for example, when an internal class implements a public interface or when a class overrides a public virtual member of a base class), so you need to
keep track of those things when determining the accessibility of a type you need.

It’s a good practice to always explicitly choose for the lowest visibility possible because you
want to hide as much information as possible. If you don’t declare any access modifer, C# assigns a default member accessibility

Type | Default  | Allowed
------------|--------------|--------------
enum | public | None
class |private | public, protected, internal, private, protected internal
interface | public | None
struct | private | public, internal, private

## 2. Data Protection

In C#, data is stored in a single variable or in an array. To protect this data from accidental damage, we have:

1. Properties
2. Indexers

### Indexers

Indexers allow instances of a class or struct to be indexed just like arrays. The indexed value can be set or retrieved without explicitly specifying a type or instance member. Indexers resemble properties except that their accessors take parameters.

```csharp
public interface ISomeInterface
{
    // Indexer declaration:
    int this[int index]
    {
        get;
        set;
    }
}

// Implementing the interface.
class IndexerClass : ISomeInterface
{
    private int[] arr = new int[100];
    public int this[int index]   // indexer declaration
    {
        get
        {
            // The arr object will throw IndexOutOfRange exception.
            return arr[index];
        }
        set
        {
            arr[index] = value;
        }
    }
}

class MainClass
{
    static void Main()
    {
        IndexerClass test = new IndexerClass();
        System.Random rand = new System.Random();
        // Call the indexer to initialize its elements.
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            test[i] = rand.Next();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            System.Console.WriteLine("Element #{0} = {1}", i, test[i]);
        }

        // Keep the console window open in debug mode.
        System.Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit.");
        System.Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
/* Sample output:
    Element #0 = 360877544
    Element #1 = 327058047
    Element #2 = 1913480832
    Element #3 = 1519039937
    Element #4 = 601472233
    Element #5 = 323352310
    Element #6 = 1422639981
    Element #7 = 1797892494
    Element #8 = 875761049
    Element #9 = 393083859
 */

```

### Properties

Properties are used to encapsulate the value of a private field. They use access specifiers, which gives better control to read, write, or manipulate a field’s value.

```csharp
interface IEmployee
{
    string Name
    {
        get;
        set;
    }

    int Counter
    {
        get;
    }
}

public class Employee : IEmployee
{
    public static int numberOfEmployees;

    private string name;
    public string Name  // read-write instance property
    {
        get
        {
            return name;
        }
        set
        {
            name = value;
        }
    }

    private int counter;
    public int Counter  // read-only instance property
    {
        get
        {
            return counter;
        }
    }

    public Employee()  // constructor
    {
        counter = ++numberOfEmployees;
    }
}

class TestEmployee
{
    static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.Write("Enter number of employees: ");
        Employee.numberOfEmployees = int.Parse(System.Console.ReadLine());

        Employee e1 = new Employee();
        System.Console.Write("Enter the name of the new employee: ");
        e1.Name = System.Console.ReadLine();

        System.Console.WriteLine("The employee information:");
        System.Console.WriteLine("Employee number: {0}", e1.Counter);
        System.Console.WriteLine("Employee name: {0}", e1.Name);
    }
}
```
