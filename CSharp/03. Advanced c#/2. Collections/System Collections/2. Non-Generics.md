# System Collections

System.Collections is a namespace which contains classes and interfaces that manages a group of data. It stores each data in the form of a system.object type. Therefore, a group of value type data always gets boxed/unboxed.

| class     | Explanation                                                 |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| ArrayList | Array of objects whose size can grow and shrink dinamically |
| Hashtable | Collection of key/value pair, organize on base of hash code |
| Queue     | Manages group of data in First In, First Out (FIFO) order   |
| Stack     | Manages group of data in Last In, First Out (LIFO) order    |

## ArrayList

Itâ€™s an array of objects which can grow and shrink its size dynamically. It can be accessed by its index. * Inserting and deleting an element at the middle of an ArrayList is more costly than inserting or deleting an element at the end an ArrayList.

Unlike arrays, an ArrayList can hold data of multiple data types.

| Method and Property | Explanation                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Add()`             | Add an object to the end of ArrayList                      |
| `Contains()`        | Return true if specific object is in ArrayList             |
| `Clone()`           | Create a shallow copy of ArrayList                         |
| `Remove()`          | Remove the first occurance of specific object in ArrayList |
| `RemoveAt()`        | Remove the object from specific index of ArrayList         |
| `Clear()`           | Remove all objects from the ArrayList                      |
| `Count`             | Get the actual number of objects stored in ArrayList       |
| `Capacity`          | Get or Set number of objects that ArrayList can contain    |

## Hashtable

Hashtable stores each element of a collection in a pair of key/values. It optimizes the lookups by computing
the hash key and stores it to access the value against it.

| Method and Property | Explanation                                              |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Add()`             | Add an element with the specified key and value          |
| `ContainsKey()`     | Return true if specific key is in Hashtable              |
| `ContainsValue`     | Return true if specific value is in Hashtable            |
| `Clone()`           | Create a shallow copy of Hashtable                       |
| `Remove()`          | Remove the element with the specified key from ArrayList |
| `Clear()`           | Remove all objects from the Hashtable                    |
| `Count`             | Get the actual number of key/value pairs in Hashtable    |
| `Keys`              | Get list of keys contains in Hashtable                   |
| `Values`            | Get list of values contains in Hashtable                 |

## Queue

Queue is a class of System.Collections namespace. It stores and retrieves objects in FIFO (First In, First Out) order. In other words, it manages a collection of objects on a first come, first served basis.

| Method and Property | Explanation                                                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Enqueue()`         | Add an element to the end of the Queue                              |
| `Dequeue()`         | Remove and return the object at the beginning of the Queue          |
| `Peek()`            | Return the object at the beginning of the queue without removing it |
| `ToArray()`         | Copy the Queue elements to a new array                              |
| `Contains()`        | Return true if a specified object is in the Queue                   |
| `Clear()`           | Remove all objects from the Queue                                   |
| `Clone()`           | Create a shallow copy of the Queue                                  |
| `Count`             | Get the actual number of objects in Queue                           |

## Stack

Stack is a class of System.Collections namespace. It stores and retrieves objects in LIFO (Last In, First Out) order. In other words, elements pushed at the end will pop first, for example, a pile of plates.

| Method and Property | Explanation                                                   |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Push()`            | Insert the object at the top of the Stack                     |
| `Pop()`             | Remove and return object at the top of the Stack              |
| `Peek()`            | Return the object at the top of the Stack without removing it |
| `ToArray()`         | Copy the Stack elements to a new array                        |
| `Contains()`        | Return true if a specified object is in the Stack             |
| `Clear()`           | Remove all objects from the Stack                             |
| `Clone()`           | Create a shallow copy of the Stack                            |
| `Count`             | Get the actual number of objects in Stack                     |
