# Delegates with Anonymous Method and lambda Expression

## Anonymous Functions

```csharp
Func<int,int,int> demoDelegate = AddTwoNumbers;
```

`AddTwoNumbers` is a trivial function that just adds two numbers and returns the value. Do we really need a function to provide such a simple operation? It is small and is getting used here only. No need to keep it around. Enter anonymous functions:

```csharp
Func<int,int,int> demoDelegate = delegate(int x,int y) {return x+y;}
```

## Lambdas

Instead of anonymous functions we can use lambda:

```csharp
Func<int,int,int> demoDelegate = (x,y) => x+y;
```

If it takes no parameters then the lambda is like:

```csharp
()=> 3
```

This one does not take a parameter and returns 3.
If it takes only single parameter then:

```csharp
x => x+100;
```

This one increments the value of the passed variable by 100 and returns the result.

And if it takes two parameters then:

```csharp
(x,y)=>
{
    //something
    return x+y;
}
```
