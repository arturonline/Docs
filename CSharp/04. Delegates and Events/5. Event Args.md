# Event Arguments

`.NET` has defined a class called `EventArgs`. You have to derive from this class to pack in any information about the event which you want to pass on to the functions handling the event.

```csharp
using System;

namespace DelegateDemo
{
    public class FileDownloader
    {
        private readonly string _fileName;

        public event EventHandler<DownloadCompleteEventArgs> FileDownloaded;

        public FileDownloader(string fileName)
        {
            _fileName = fileName;
        }
        public void StartFileDownload()
        {
            //Assume the file downloaded successfully
            //Raise event to subscribers notifying them
            RaiseFileDownloadedEvent(new DownloadCompleteEventArgs(_fileName));
        }

        protected virtual void RaiseFileDownloadedEvent(DownloadCompleteEventArgs eventArgs)
        {
            FileDownloaded?.Invoke(this, eventArgs);
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
using System;

namespace DelegateDemo
{
    public class Reader
    {
        public Reader(FileDownloader fileDownloader)
        {
            fileDownloader.FileDownloaded += OnFileDownloaded;
        }

        private void OnFileDownloaded(object sender, DownloadCompleteEventArgs e)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("\nThe book '" + e.FileName + "' has been read by Reader A");
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
using System;

namespace DelegateDemo
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            FileDownloader fileDownloader = new FileDownloader("How to win a lottery");
            Reader clientA = new Reader(fileDownloader);
            fileDownloader.StartFileDownload();
        }
    }
}

// The book "How to win a lottery" has been read by Reader A
// Press any key to continue
