# Compiler directives

| Directives | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `#define`  | `#define` directive is used to define a symbol which might be a character or sequence of characters.                                                                 |
| `#undef`   | `#undef` directive is used to undefine the defined symbol using #define directive or in compiler option. It must be on the top of non-directive code.                |
| `#if`      | `#if` directive is used to evaluate the symbol defined and execute its code if it finds the symbol defined. This directive is always followed by `#endif` directive. |
| `#else`    | `#else` is used to create a compound directive with #if or #elif and execute its code when `#if` or `#elif` is false.                                                |
| `#elif`    | `#elif` directive also creates a compound directive with `#if` or elif and executes its code when it finds its condition or symbol to be true.                       |
| `#endif`   | This directive is used with `#if` directive, which tells the end of a conditional directive.                                                                         |
| `#error`   | `#error` directive is used to generate error from a specific location in your code.                                                                                  |
| `#warning` | Its use is the same as `#error` directive but generates a level one warning.                                                                                         |
| `#region`  |   lets you specify a block of code that you can expand or collapse when using the outlining feature of the Visual Studio Code Editor.                                |
| `#endregion`|    marks the end of a #region block.                                              |
| `#pragma`    |     gives the compiler special instructions for the compilation of the file in which it appears.                                            |
| `#pragma warning` |     can enable or disable certain warnings.                                             |
| `#pragma checksum`|               Generates checksums for source files to aid with debugging ASP.NET pages.                                  |

When using the `#if` directive, you can use the operators you are used to from C#: `==` (equality), `!=` (inequality), `&&` (and), `||` (or) and `!` (not) to test for true or false.

## `#Error`

`#error` is commonly used in a conditional directive. This directive generates a specific error at a specific location and shows in “Error List” (tool window in Visual Studio):

```csharp
#if hamza
    Console.WriteLine("hamza (Symbol) is defined");
#else
    Console.WriteLine("No Symbol Defined");
#error No Symbol Defined
#endif
```

## `#line`

You can renumber the compiler line number using this directive to give a line number and optionally rename the filename by giving the name (in string format) in which the code resides. You can also make the line number hidden by `#line hidden` (that will hide successive lines from debugger) and turn back to normal line number behavior by using `#line default`.

The following example shows how to report two warnings associated with line numbers. The `#line 200` directive forces the next line's number to be 200 (although the default is `#6`) and until the next `#line` directive, the filename will be reported as *"Special"*. The `#line default` directive returns the line numbering to its default numbering, which counts the lines that were renumbered by the previous directive.

```csharp
class MainClass  
{  
    static void Main()  
    {  
#line 200 "Special"  
        int i;
        int j;
#line default  
        char c;
        float f;
#line hidden // numbering not affected  
        string s;   
        double d;
    }  
}
```

Debug next example by pressing F11 and you will move line by line, but debugger will not encounter with
the following statement “Console.WriteLine("Hidden Line No");” as its line number is hidden; that’s why
debugger will miss it and move to line number 101 (if any) and then navigate to default behavior.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
        Console.WriteLine("Default/Normal Line No")
    #line 100
        Console.WriteLine("Override Line No");
    #line hidden
        Console.WriteLine("Hidden Line No");
    #line default
        Console.WriteLine("Default/Noraml Line No");
}
```

## `#pragma`

When building an application, you sometimes willingly write some code that triggers a warning. You don’t want to change the code, but you do want to hide the warning. You can do this by using the `#pragma` warning directive.

```csharp
#pragma warning disable
while (false)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Unreachable code");
}
#pragma warning restore
```

You can also choose to disable or restore specifc warnings, as shown in the next example. The compiler won’t report a warning for the `int i` statement, but it will report a warning for the unreachable code:

```csharp
#pragma warning disable 0162, 0168
int i;
#pragma warning restore 0162
while (false)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Unreachable code");
}
#pragma warning restore
```

## `#pragma checksum`

```csharp

#pragma checksum "filename" "{guid}" "checksum bytes"  
```

Parameters

- **"filename"**: The name of the file that requires monitoring for changes or updates.
- **"{guid}"**: The Globally Unique Identifier (GUID) for the hash algorithm.  
- **"checksum_bytes"**: The string of hexadecimal digits representing the bytes of the checksum. Must be an even number of hexadecimal digits. An odd number of digits results in a compile-time warning, and the directive are ignored.

```csharp
class TestClass  
{  
    static int Main()  
    {  
        #pragma checksum "file.cs" "{406EA660-64CF-4C82-B6F0-42D48172A799}" "ab007f1d23d9" // New checksum  
    }  
}
```
