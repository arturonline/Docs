# Implement Logging and tracing

When your application is running on a production server, it’s sometimes impossible to attach a debugger because of security restrictions or the nature of the application. Because of this, it’s important that you implement a logging and tracing strategy right from the start.

Tracing is a way for you to monitor the execution of your application while it’s running and write that information to a specified target: an output window, a file, a database, or event log.

Tracing has three main phases:

1. **Instrumenting**: Adding tracing code in your application.
2. **Logging** gives you the facility to record the errors or report the errors to a specified target (file, db, event log...).
3. **Analysis**: After getting the issues described in a specific format or written in a specific target, you analyze the details and identify the problem.

## Working with Debug and Trace Class

Debug and Trace classes can be used to trace and log the errors that occurred in an application. Normally, Debug and Trace classes use Listeners to log traced errors. These classes provide a couple of methods for tracing and put those traced errors into files, a database, or EventLogs.

Debug class is normally used in Debug Mode for tracing and logging. Trace class is used in Release Mode.

## Debug and Trace Common Methods

| Debug       | Trace                                                                                  | Description                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Assert      | Assert                                                                                 | Checks the Boolean condition and throws an exception on a false condition with a call stack (traced information about error).                                |
| Flush       | Flush                                                                                  | Flushes the buffers and puts the write-buffered data into Listeners.                                                                                         |
| Indent      | Indent                                                                                 | Increases the Indent by one level.                                                                                                                           |
| UnIndent    | UnIndent                                                                               | Decreases the indent by one level.                                                                                                                           |
| Write       | Write                                                                                  | Writes to message to trace listener.                                                                                                                         |
| WriteIf     | WriteIf                                                                                | Takes the condition and Writes the message to trace listener if the condition is true.                                                                       |
| WriteLine   | WriteLine                                                                              | Writes the message to Debug's Listeners collection by line terminator. It is an overloaded function and provides more interactivity to log the traced error. |
| WriteLineIf | WriteLineIf  | Behave same as WriteLine method but makes proceeding based on a condition. |

You can use these functions to trace and print out the errors(log) and use Listener instance (TraceListeners provided in C#) to log traced information to specific target.

### Debug Class

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("Tracing Start");

        int age = 10;
        Debug.WriteLineIf(age.GetType() == typeof(int), "Age is Valid");

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
        {
            Debug.WriteLine("Loop executed Successfully");
        }
        Debug.Print("Tracing Finished");
    }
    catch (Exception)
    {
        Debug.Assert(false);
    }
}
```

### Trace Classs

You can also use Trace class for such a purpose. For example, we have two numbers and want to evaluate that they must be int and the divisor should not be zero, if zero changes the value and provides the information.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    try
    {
        Trace.WriteLine("Tracing Start: Numbers must be Int");

        int num1 = 10;
        int num2 = 0;

        Trace.WriteLineIf(num1.GetType() == typeof(int) && num2.GetType() == typeof(int), "Numbers are valid");
        if (num2 < 1)
        {
            num2 = num1;
            Trace.TraceInformation("num2 has been changed due to zero value");
        }
        int result = num1 / num2;
        Trace.Indent();
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Trace.Assert(false);
        Trace.TraceError(ex.Message);
    }
}
```

`TraceInformation` provides the information about the error which occurred or which you want to occur. The same code executes again without the if condition; the exception occurred due to the 0 value of the divisor and the Assert method gives you the call stack of error in a message box. But if you want to record such a traced error (to log your error), you would use the TraceError method in such a situation. It logs down the call stack to the output window (default listener).

### TraceSource

Another class which comes in handy is `TraceSource`, and it’s more preferable to use than static Trace class.

```csharp
TraceSource ts = new TraceSource("TraceSource1", SourceLevels.All);
ts.TraceInformation("Tracing the application..");
ts.TraceEvent(TraceEventType.Error, 0, "Error trace Event");
ts.TraceData(TraceEventType.Information, 1, new string[]{ "Info1","Info2" });
ts.Flush();//flush the buffers
ts.Close();//close the listeners (in this case listener is outout window)
```

`TraceSource` class has some extra functions. Some of them, like TraceEvent and TraceData, are used here. TraceEvent will write down the trace event message/error with the event type and numeric identifier to the trace listener, whereas TraceData will write down traced data to the listener along with the event type, event identifier, and trace data in an array form. The event type provided in TraceEvent and TraceData method is enumeration: Critical, Error, Warning, Information, Verbose, Stop, Start, Suspend, Resume, Transfer. TraceSource class has two overloaded constructors in which you can give the name of TraceSouce or name along with SourceLevel (tracing to which level). It is also an enumeration: ActivityTracing, All, Critical, Error, Information, Off, Verbose, Warning.

Trace or TraceSource class gives you more interactivity with the issues in an application when it is in real use, as opposed to Debug class.

## Working with Trace Listeners

Writing all information to the Output window can be useful during debug sessions, but not in a production environment. To change this behavior, both the Debug and TraceSource classes have a Listeners property. This property holds a collection of TraceListeners, which process the information from the Write, Fail, and Trace methods.

Out of the box, both the Debug and the TraceSource class use an instance of the DefaultTraceListener class. The DefaultTraceListener writes to the Output window and shows the message box when assertion fails.

You can use several other TraceListeners that are a part of the .NET Framework. 

Name | Output
-----|------------
`ConsoleTraceListener`  | Standard output or error stream
`DelimitedListTraceListener`  | TextWriter
`EventLogTraceListener`  | EventLog
`EventSchemaTraceListener`  | XML-encoded, schema-compliant log fle
`TextWriterTraceListener`  | TextWriter
`XmlWriterTraceListener`  | XML-encoded data to a TextWriter or stream.

To work with such listeners, you must clear the default listener first. You can have as many listeners as
you want You can add as many listeners as you want:

```csharp
Stream outputFile = File.Create("tracefile.txt");
TextWriterTraceListener textListener = new TextWriterTraceListener(outputFile);
TraceSource traceSource = new TraceSource("myTraceSource", SourceLevels.All);

traceSource.Listeners.Clear();
traceSource.Listeners.Add(textListener);

traceSource.TraceInformation("Trace output");

traceSource.Flush();
traceSource.Close();
```

### ConsoleTraceListener

This listener logs the errors or outputs them to a console screen (Target), which is standard output.

```csharp
//specify the trace source
TraceSource ts = new TraceSource("ConsoleTraceSource", SourceLevels.All);

//Specify the listener (Console would be the Target)
ConsoleTraceListener listener = new ConsoleTraceListener();

//clear the default listener
ts.Listeners.Clear();

//adding the listener
ts.Listeners.Add(listener);

//tracing the information/issue which will log into added listener
ts.TraceInformation("Tracing the application..");
ts.TraceData(TraceEventType.Error, 1, new string[] { "Error1", "Error2" });

ts.Flush();
ts.Close();
```

### TextWriterTraceListener

This listener logs the debugged or traced data into text files (target). You can also read traced data from the file.

```csharp
//specify the trace source
TraceSource ts = new TraceSource("SampleTraceSource", SourceLevels.All);

//Specify the target for TextWriterTraceListener
Stream file = new FileStream("TraceFile.txt", FileMode.Append);

//Specify the listener
TextWriterTraceListener txtListener = new TextWriterTraceListener(file);

//clear the default listener
ts.Listeners.Clear();

//adding the listener
ts.Listeners.Add(txtListener);

//tracing the information/issue which will log into added listener
ts.TraceInformation("Tracing the application..");
ts.TraceData(TraceEventType.Error, 1, new string[] { "Error1", "Error2" });
ts.TraceInformation("Tracing complete");

ts.Flush();
ts.Close();
```

You can also specify the listeners in a configuration file, which is more beneficial than specifying in code
because you can easily change them after the deployment of an application

The following configuration code shows how to specify the listeners in a configuration file:

```xml
<sources>
<source name="SampleTraceSource" switchName="defaultSwitch">
<listeners>
<add initializeData="TraceFile.txt" name="txtListener" type="System.Diagnostics.
TextWriterTraceListeer">
<filter type="System.Diagnostics.EventTypeFilter" initializeData="Error"/>
</add>
<add name="consoleListener" />
<remove name="Default"/>
</listeners>
</source>
</sources>
<switches>
<add name="defaultSwitch" value="All" />
</switches>
```

You can give the source of a trace listener inside the sources tag, where you specify the source of the listener. This source can use two trace listeners: text and console.
The switch tag is also defined, which is used by the trace source; this is what we also did in our code to specify the source label in the TraceSource constructor. Its value specifies how to deal with incoming messages: “All” means all types of messages. You can specify which type of message can be viewed this way. Switch works on the TraceSource level, so its impact will be on all the listeners defined under a trace source. To specify the type of message you can see, or determine which event is processed for a specific listener, you can apply a filter. This is commonly used in such cases where you have multiple listeners
under a trace source.

### EventLogTraceListener

Event Log received the traced information and recorded information about the important events of an application. This trace listener logged the traced or debugged data into the EventLogs of Windows (Target). You can also read the EventLogs with the administrative permission, using the provided class EventLog.
EventLog is a class used to access EventLogs, which records information about the important event of an application. You can read from existing logs, create new logs and write to them, or create and delete an
event source.

Create Event Source:

```csharp
string sourceName = "Sample Log";
string logName = "Application";
string machineName = ".";// . means local machine
string entryTowritten = "Some random entry into Event Log";
if (!EventLog.SourceExists(sourceName, machineName))
{
    EventLog.CreateEventSource(sourceName, logName);
}
EventLog.WriteEntry(sourceName,entryTowritten,EventLogEntryType.Information);
```

CreateEventSource method is used to create the source of an event (creation of new EventLog) with the provided name. Log name, which is an application, is optional. Log is a category or something similar to a file in which source entries are to be written. There are three types of Logs: Application, System, or Custom log.
To write data or an entry into an EventLog, you use the WriteEntry method, in which you have to know what to write, where to write, and what should be the level of data to be written.

You can also read the EventLog. For example, I need to read the latest information of Sample Log.

The following code helps you out:

```csharp
string sourceName = "Sample Log";
string logName = "Application";
string machineName = ".";// . means local machine

EventLog log = new EventLog(logName,machineName,sourceName);
Console.WriteLine("Total entries: " + log.Entries.Count);

EventLogEntry last = log.Entries[log.Entries.Count - 1];//last(latest) log with "Sample Log"
name

Console.WriteLine("Index: " + last.Index);
Console.WriteLine("Source: " + last.Source);
Console.WriteLine("Type: " + last.EntryType);
Console.WriteLine("Time: " + last.TimeWritten);
Console.WriteLine("Message: " + last.Message);
Console.WriteLine("Machine Name: " + last.MachineName);
Console.WriteLine("Category: " + last.Category);
```

Use of EventLogTraceListener:

```csharp
string sourceName = "Sample Log";
string logName = "Application";
string machineName = ".";// . means local machine

//Creation of log
if (!EventLog.SourceExists(sourceName, machineName))
{
  EventLog.CreateEventSource(sourceName, logName);//EventLog created
}

//Specifing created log (target)
EventLog log = new EventLog();
log.Source = sourceName;
log.Log = logName;
log.MachineName = machineName;

//specify the EventLog trace listener
EventLogTraceListener eventLogListener = new EventLogTraceListener();

//specify the target to listener
eventLogListener.EventLog = log;

//specifing the Trace class
trace information

//Clearing default listener
trace.Listeners.Clear();

//assigning new listener
trace.Listeners.Add(eventLogListener);

//Start tracing
trace.TraceInformation("Tracing start to Event Log");

trace.Flush();
trace.Close();
```
