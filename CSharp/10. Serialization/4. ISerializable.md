# Custom Serialization

Custom serialization allows an object to control its own serialization and deserialization. One of the ways to implement a custom serialization is to implement an `ISerializable` interface on an object’s Type.

## Using ISerializable

ISerializable is an interface that allows you to implement custom serialization. This interface involves the `GetObjectData()` method and a special constructor that is used when the object is deserialized.

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Teacher : ISerializable
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }

    public Teacher()
    {
    }

    protected Teacher(SerializationInfo info,StreamingContext context)
    {
    this.ID = info.GetInt32("IDKey");
    this.Name = info.GetString("NameKey");
    }

    [SecurityPermissionAttribute(SecurityAction.Demand,SerializationFormatter = true)]
    public void GetObjectData(SerializationInfo info, StreamingContext context)
    {
        info.AddValue("IDKey", 1);
        info.AddValue("NameKey", "Hamza")
    }
}
```

Explanation:

`GetObjectData()` method is called during serialization and you need to populate the `SerializationInfo` provided with the method call. Add the variable or value to be serialized with the name associated with it in the `AddValue()` method of SerializationInfo’s object. You can use any text as a name associated with a value or variable. You can add any or a few number of variables provided with the method call in SerializationInfo’s object. These provided variables or values will be serialized.

With deserialization, a special constructor would call and serialized values deserialize by calling the Get method of the SerializationInfo’s object.
