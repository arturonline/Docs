# DataContract

The `DataContractSerializer` class is used to serialize and deserialize instances of a type into an XML stream or document. For example, you can create a type named *Person* with properties that contain essential data, such as a name and address. You can then create and manipulate an instance of the *Person* class and write all of its property values in an XML document for later retrieval, or in an XML stream for immediate transport.

## Differences with binary and xml serialization

The main differences between DataContractSerializer and XmlSerializer are:

1. Instead of using `Serializable Attribute`, you use `DataContract attribute`.
2. Members are not serialized by default as in `XmlSerializer`.
3. All the members you want to serialize must be explicitly marked with a `DataMember attribute`.
4. To ignore a member to be serialized, you use the `IgnoreDataMember` attribute instead of `XmlIgnore`.
5. Private fields are also serializable by DataContractSerializer, which is not possible in XmlSerializer.
6. In DataContractSerializer, you use the `WriteObject()` method to serialize an object and `ReadObject()` method to deserialize the stream into an object.

This type of serialization is used when you use WCF (Windows Communication Foundation). The Data Contract Serializer is used by WCF to serialize your objects to *XML* or *JSON*.

## Using DataContract Serializer

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Teacher
{
    [DataMember] // specifies that the member is serializable.
    private int id = 1;
    [DataMember]
    public string name { get; set; }
    [IgnoreDataMember] // specifies that the member is not serialized.
    public long salary { get; set; }
}

//Serialization
DataContractSerializer dataContract = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Create))
{
    dataContract.WriteObject(stream, t); // Writes all the object data to an XML document or stream.
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");

//Deserialization
Teacher teacher = null;
DataContractSerializer dataContract = new DataContractSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Open))
{
    teacher = (Teacher)dataContract.ReadObject(stream);
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```
