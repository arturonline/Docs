# XML Serialization

XML serialization is the process of converting an object's public properties and fields to XML format.

## Using XML Serializer

To perform XML serialization, you mark your type with a *Serializable attribute* which tells the .NET framework that type should be serializable.

The central class in the namespace is the `XmlSerializer` class. To use this class, use the `XmlSerializer` constructor to create an instance of the class using the type of the object to serialize. Once an `XmlSerializer` is created, create an instance of the object to serialize. You must also create an object to write the file to a document or stream, such as a `Stream`, `TextWriter`, or `XmlWriter`. You can then call the Serialize method to convert the object into an XML document.

```csharp
[Serializable]
public class Teacher
{
    public int ID { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public long Salary { get; set; }
}

//Created the Instance and initialized
Teacher teacher = new Teacher()
{
    ID = 1,
    Name = "Ijaz",
    Salary = 1000
};

XmlSerializer xml = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Create))
{
    xml.Serialize(stream, teacher);
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");
```

To deserialize an object from an XML document, create a suitable object to read the document or stream (again, a `Stream`, `TextWriter`, or `XmlWriter`). Invoke the Deserialize method while casting the resulting object to the type of the original object.

```csharp
Teacher teacher = null;
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Open))
{
    XmlSerializer xml = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
    teacher = (Teacher)xml.Deserialize(stream);
}

Console.WriteLine(teacher.ID);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.Name);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.Salary);

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```

The serialized object in XML format looks like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Teacher xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema">
<ID>2</ID>
<Name>Ahsan</Name>
<Salary>20000</Salary>
</Teacher>
```

## Attributes

To further control the serialization, the `System.Xml.Serialization` namespace contains several Attribute classes that can be applied to members of a class. For example, if a class contains a member that will be serialized as an XML element, you can apply the `XmlElementAttribute` attribute to the member. When applying the attribute, you can specify details such as the actual XML element name using the `ElementName` property. For a complete list of all the attributes, see the `XmlSerializer` class overview.

The following are important attributes that are commonly used:

1. `XmlRoot`: Applied on Type, which tells the compiler that this is going to be the  main/parent Node of a Serialized object in XML.
2. `XmlAttribute`: Applied on any of the public fields mapped into an attribute on its parent node.
3. `XmlElement`: Applied on any of the public fields mapped into an element of a parent node.
4. `XmlIgnore`: Applied on any of the public fields which will not be serialized.
5. `XmlArray`, XmlArrayItem: These two (XmlArray and XmlArrayItem) can be applied on any of the public fields of the type collection for serialization.

By default, each public field of your type is serialized as XmlElement.

```csharp
// Controlled XML serialization
[Serializable]
[XmlRoot("Teacher")]
public class teacherClass
{
    [XmlAttribute("ID")]
    public int id { get; set; }
    [XmlElement("Name")]
    public string name { get; set; }
    [XmlIgnore]
    public long salary { get; set; }
    [XmlElement("Students")]
    public studentClass st { get; set; }
}

[Serializable]
public class studentClass
{
    [XmlAttribute("RollNo")]
    public int rollno { get; set; }
    [XmlElement("Marks")]
    public int marks { get; set; }
}

//Serialization
teacherClass t = new teacherClass
{
    id = 2,
    name = "Ahsan",
    salary = 20000,
    st = new studentClass
    {
        rollno = 1,
        marks = 50
    }
};

XmlSerializer xml = new XmlSerializer(typeof(teacherClass));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Create))
{
    xml.Serialize(stream, t);
}
Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");
```

```csharp
//Deserialization
teacherClass teacher = null;
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.xml", FileMode.Open))
{
    XmlSerializer xml = new XmlSerializer(typeof(teacherClass));
    teacher = (teacherClass)xml.Deserialize(stream);
}

Console.WriteLine(teacher.id);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.name);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.salary);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.st.rollno);
Console.WriteLine(teacher.st.marks);
Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```

The serialized object in XML format looks like:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<Teacher xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" ID="2">
<Name>Ahsan</Name>
<Students RollNo="1">
<Marks>50</Marks>
</Students>
</Teacher>
```
