Cryptography is mainly used to send data from an insecure channel so that data can reach its destination successfully. It is performed by doing Encryption on data.

Encryption is the process of transforming a plain text into an unreadable form of cipher text by performing some algorithms on it. Decryption is the reverse process.

.NET provides a set of cryptographic objects, supporting well-known algorithms and common uses including hashing, encryption, and generating digital signatures. You can use a combination of algorithms and practices known as cryptographic primitives to create a cryptographic scheme. The following table lists the cryptographic primitives and their uses:

| Cryptographic primitive                         | Use                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secret-key encryption (symmetric cryptography)  | Performs a transformation on data to keep it from being read by third parties. This type of encryption uses a single shared, secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. |
| Public-key encryption (asymmetric cryptography) | Performs a transformation on data to keep it from being read by third parties. This type of encryption uses a public/private key pair to encrypt and decrypt data.   |
| Cryptographic signing                           | Helps verify that data originates from a specific party by creating a digital signature that is unique to that party. This process also uses hash functions.         |
| Cryptographic hashes                            | Maps data from any length to a fixed-length byte sequence. Hashes are statistically unique; a different two-byte sequence will not hash to the same value.           |

## Symmetric vs Asymmetric

### Symmetric

Secret-key encryption algorithms use a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data. Because of this is also referred as symmetric encryption. You must secure the key from access by unauthorized agents, because any party that has the key can use it to decrypt your data or encrypt their own data, claiming it originated from you.

 Secret-key encryption algorithms are very fast (compared with public-key algorithms) and are well suited for performing cryptographic transformations on large streams of data.

| Algorithm | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| AES       | AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is a symmetric algorithm. It was designed for both software and hardware. It has support for 128-bit data and 128,192,256-bit key. |
| DES       | DES (Data Encryption Standard) is a symmetric algorithm published by National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST).                                            |
| RC2       | RC2 (Ron’s Code or Rivest Cipher) also known as ARC2 is a symmetric algorithm designed by Ron Rivest.                                                                 |
| Rijndael  | Rijndael is symmetric algorithm chosen by NSA as a Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).                                                                                |
| TripleDes | TripleDes also known as 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standard) applies DES algorithm three times to each data block.                                                  |

These symmetric algorithm are defined in .NET and can be found their classes in `System.Security.Cryptography`.

Symmetic encryption:

```csharp
//specify the data
string plainData = "Secret Message";

//convert into bytes of array
byte[] plainDataInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(plainData);

//Create a default cryptography object used to perform symmetric encryption
SymmetricAlgorithm symmetricAlgo = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();

//Create encryptor with key and IV (Optional)
ICryptoTransform encryptor = symmetricAlgo.CreateEncryptor(symmetricAlgo.Key, symmetricAlgo.IV);
byte[] cipherDataInBytes = encryptor.TransformFinalBlock(plainDataInBytes, 0, plainDataInBytes.Length);

//get the bytes of encrypted data into string
string cipherData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(cipherDataInBytes);
Console.WriteLine("Encrypted Data is: "+ cipherData);
```

Symmetric Decryption:

```csharp
//Create a default cryptography object used to perform symmetric encryption
SymmetricAlgorithm symmetricAlgo = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();

ICryptoTransform decryptor = symmetricAlgo.CreateDecryptor(symmetricAlgo.Key, symmetricAlgo.IV);

byte[] plainDataInBytes = decryptor.TransformFinalBlock(cipherDataInBytes, 0, cipherDataInBytes.Length);

string plainData= Encoding.UTF8.GetString(plainDataInBytes);

Console.WriteLine("Decrypted Data is: " + plainData);
```

### Asymmetric (public-key encryption)

The public key encryption uses two different keys that are mathematically related to each other. Because of this is also referred as asymmetric encryption. Although they are related, it’s infeasible to determine one key when you know the other. One key is completely public and can be read and used for encrypting data by everyone. The other part is private and should never be shared with someone else. When you encrypt something with the public key, it can be decrypted by using the private key, and vice versa.

You should Keep your private key safe with .Net `containers` using `CspParameters`.

| Algorithm       | Description                                                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RSA             | RSA is an asymmetric algorithm commonly used by modern computers.                                                   |
| DSA             | DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm), produced by NIST, is a standard to create digital signatures for data integrity. |
| ECDsa           | ECDsa (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature) offers variant of the DSA.                                                 |
| ECDiffieHellman | Provides a basic set of operations that ECDH implementations must support.                                          |

These Asymmetric algorithms are defined in .NET and their classes can be found in `System.Security.Cryptography`.

DSA asymmetric enryption:

```csharp
//Creation of asymmetric algo object
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();

//saving the key information to RSAParameters structure
RSAParameters RSAKeyInfo = rsa.ExportParameters(false);

//generating both keys( public and private)
string publicKey = rsa.ToXmlString(false);
string privateKey = rsa.ToXmlString(true);
```

`ToXmlString` method returns the public or private key based on the Boolean value. To generate a private key make the value true, and for a public key the value shall be false. Now we have two interlinked keys of an asymmetric algorithm. If A wants to send data to B then both parties should have an understanding about the pattern or keys used for communication between them.

The recipient (B) should have the private key for decryption and the sender (A) will encrypt data using the public key. The data that traveled to B will only be decrypted with the secret key which generated along with the public key (used for encryption).

encrypt and decrypt data with public key, private key:

```csharp
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider();

//Encrypting Code (On Sender side)

//data to encrypt
string data = "Secret Message";
//convert into bytes
byte[] dataInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(data);

//Specify the public key obtained from receiver
rsa.FromXmlString(publicKey);

//Use Encrypt method for encryption
byte[] encryptedDataInBytes = rsa.Encrypt(dataInBytes, true);

//get the bytes of encrypted data into string
string encryptedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(encryptedDataInBytes);

Console.WriteLine("\nEncrypted Data is: "+ encryptedData);

//Decrpyting Code (on receiver side)

//Specify the private key
rsa.FromXmlString(privateKey);

//Use Decrypt method for encryption
byte[] decryptedDataInBytes= rsa.Decrypt(encryptedDataInBytes, true);

//get the bytes of decrypted data into string
string decryptedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decryptedDataInBytes);

Console.WriteLine("Decrypted Data is: "+ decryptedData);
```

You can use a private key (instead of public) for encryption and public for decryption. One could be known to all and the other must be secret.

## Key Management

### Symmetric Keys

In a symmetric algorithm, keys must be private, whereas there is no compulsion for an IV.

```csharp
SymmetricAlgorithm symmetric = SymmetricAlgorithm.Create();
symmetric.GenerateIV();
symmetric.GenerateKey();
```

### Asymmetric Keys

The private key should be stored securely so that no unauthorized person can steal it. For this purpose, you should use a key container to manage the private key.

Store private key in key container:

```csharp
//Creating the container

CspParameters parameter = new CspParameters();
parameter.KeyContainerName = "KeyContainer";

//Creation of asymmetric algo object
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(parameter);

//saving the key information to RSAParameters structure
RSAParameters RSAKeyInfo = rsa.ExportParameters(false);
string privateKey = rsa.ToXmlString(true);

Console.WriteLine("Key is stored in Container"+ privateKey);
```

Delete key from key container:

```csharp
//Creating the container

CspParameters parameter = new CspParameters();
parameter.KeyContainerName = SET THE NAME OF THAT KEY CONTAINER USED TO STORE KEY;

//Creation of asymmetric algo object
RSACryptoServiceProvider rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider(parameter);

//saving the key information to RSAParameters structure
RSAParameters RSAKeyInfo = rsa.ExportParameters(false);

rsa.PersistKeyInCsp = false;
rsa.Clear();

Console.WriteLine("Key is Deleted");
```

## Choosing an appropriate Algorithm

When you have multiple algorithms for performing encryption or hashing, then it is important to choose the best algorithm with respect to the scenario. The following points illustrate the usage of different commonly used algorithms with respect to the scenario.

1. When there is a scenario to deal with more sensitive data, you should use **Asymmetric encryption** instead of symmetric encryption.
2. When there is a scenario for **data privacy**, use `Aes` (Symmetric algorithm).
3. When there is a scenario for **Data Integrity**, use `HMACSHA256` and `HMACSHA512` hashing algorithms.
4. When there is a scenario for **digital signing** (Digital Signature) or key exchange, use `ECDsa` and `RSA`.
5. When there is a scenario to generate a **random number**, use `RNGCryptoServiceProvider`.
6. For **generating a key from a password**, use `Rfc2898DeriveBytes`.

## Protect - Unprotect

Sometimes you might just need to keep data safely without thinking too much about the algorithm used or how it is implemented. For example, in order for an encryption algorithm to be effective, you will need to protect the shared secret for a symmetric algorithm, and the private key for an asymmetric algorithm. To solve this kind of problems, .NET Framework offers in the `System.Security.Cryptography` namespace one static class named `ProtectedData`. This class has two static methods: `Protect` and `Unprotect`. As the name implies, the first one is used to encrypt the data, and the second one is used to decrypt the data.

### Protect

Protect method is the static method of ProtectedData class; it is used to encrypt the data. It contains the following method signature:

```csharp
public static byte[] Protect(byte[] userData,byte[] optionalEntropy, DataProtectionScope scope)
```

- **userData**: An array of bytes that contains data to be encrypted.
- **optionalEntropy**: Is an optional byte array that is used to increase the complexity of the encryption, or null for no additional complexity.
- **scope**: It takes the value of the `DataProtectionScope` enumeration that specifies who can decrypt the data. The values it can take are:
  - `DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser`: specifies that only the current user can decrypt the encrypted data.
  - `DataProtectionScope.LocalMachine`: specifies that any logged-in user on the local machine will be able to decrypt the data.

Encrypt by Protect method:

```csharp
string message = "Hello World";

//Convert data into a byte array
byte[] userData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(message);

//encrypt the data by using ProtectedData.Protect method
byte[] encryptedDataInBytes = ProtectedData.Protect(userData, null, DataProtectionScope.
CurrentUser);

string encryptedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(encryptedDataInBytes);

Console.WriteLine("Encrypted Data is: " + encryptedData);
```

### Unprotect

Unprotect method is the the static method of the ProtectedData class; it is used to decrypt the encrypted data. The method signature of both Protect and Unprotect methods are the same:

```csharp
public static byte[] Unprotect(byte[] userData,byte[] optionalEntropy, DataProtectionScope scope)
```

Example:

```csharp
byte[] decryptedDataInBytes = ProtectedData.Unprotect(encryptedDataInBytes, null,
DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser);

string decryptedData = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(decryptedDataInBytes);

Console.WriteLine("Decrypted Data is: " + decryptedData);
```
