# Using the parallel class

`The System.Threading.Tasks` namespace also contains another class that can be used for parallel processing. The Parallel class provides library-based data parallel replacements for common operations such as for loops, for each loops, and execution of a set of statements.

Parallelism involves taking a certain task and splitting it into a set of related tasks that can be executed concurrently. This also means that you shouldn’t go through your code to replace all your loops with parallel loops. You should use the Parallel class only when your code doesn’t have to be executed sequentially.

Increasing performance with parallel processing happens only when you have a lot of work to be done that can be executed in parallel. For smaller work sets or for work that has to synchronize access to resources, using the Parallel class can hurt performance.

The best way to know whether it will work in your situation is to measure the results.

```Csharp
Parallel.For(0, 10, i =>
{
  Thread.Sleep(1000);
});

var numbers = Enumerable.Range(0, 10);
Parallel.ForEach(numbers, i =>
{
  Thread.Sleep(1000);
});
```

You can cancel the loop by using the `ParallelLoopState` object. You have two options to do this: `Break` or `Stop`. `Break` ensures that all iterations that are currently running will be fnished.

`Stop` just terminates everything.

```csharp
ParallelLoopResult result = Parallel.
  For(0, 1000, (int i, ParallelLoopState loopState) =>
{
  if (i == 500)
  {
    Console.WriteLine(“Breaking loop”);
    loopState.Break();
  }
    return;
});
```

When breaking the parallel loop, the result variable has an IsCompleted value of false and a LowestBreakIteration of 500. When you use the Stop method, the LowestBreakIteration is null.

## In .NET, you can take advantage of parallelism by

1. Concurrent Collection
2. Parallel.For & Parallel.Foreach
3. PLINQ

### Concurrent Collection

.NET has its own thread-safe collection called Concurrent collection. It contains the following thread-safe collections defined in the `System.Collections.Concurrent` namespace:

1. `ConcurrentDictionary<K,V>`: Thread-safe dictionary in key value pairs
2. `ConcurrentQueue<T>`: Thread-safe FIFO data structure
3. `ConcurrentStack<T>`: Thread-safe LIFO data structure
4. `ConcurrentBag<T>`: Thread-safe implementation of an unordered collection

### Parallel.For & Parallel.Foreach

Parallel.For and Parallel.Foreach are used in parallel programming to iterate statements over multiple threads.

#### Parallel.For

It is used to iterate a for loop upon multiple threads and processors. In most cases, `Parallel.For loop` is much faster than a normal for loop.

```csharp
Parallel.For(fromInclusive, toExclusive, Action<int> body);
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Parallel.For(1, 5, (i) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine(i);
        });
    }
}

//Output 1
// 3
// 4
// 2
/* output will be different when you run the same code, because in a multithreaded
enviroment, the scheduler decides which thread should run first */
```

#### Parallel.Foreach

It is used to iterate a foreach loop upon multiple threads and processors. In most cases, Parallel.Foreach loop is much faster than a normal foreach loop.

Syntax

```csharp
Parallel.ForEach<T>(collection<T> data, Action<T> body);
```

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] data = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
        Parallel.ForEach<int>(data, (d) =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine(d);
        });
    }
}
// Output:
// 1
// 3
// 4
// 2
// 5
/* output will be different when you run the same code, because in a multithreaded
enviroment the scheduler decides which thread should run first */
```

#### Parallel.Invoke

Invoking methods or actions in parallel (Parallel region)

```csharp
static void Main()
{
    string [] urls =
    {
        "www.stackoverflow.com",
        "www.google.net",
        "www.facebook.com",
        "www.twitter.com"
};
    System.Threading.Tasks.Parallel.Invoke(
        () => PingUrl(urls[0]),
        () => PingUrl(urls[1]),
        () => PingUrl(urls[2]),
        () => PingUrl(urls[3])
    );
}
void PingUrl(string url)
{
    var ping = new System.Net.NetworkInformation.Ping();
    var result = ping.Send(url);
    if (result.Status == System.Net.NetworkInformation.IPStatus.Success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(string.Format("{0} is online", url));
    }
}
```
