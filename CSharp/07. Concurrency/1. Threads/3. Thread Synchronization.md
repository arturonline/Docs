# Thread Synchronization

Synchronization is the coordination of the actions of threads for a predictable outcome.

## Local Versus Shared State

The *CLR* assigns each thread its own memory stack so that local variables are kept separate. In the next example, we define a method with a local variable, then call the method simultaneously on the main thread and a newly created thread:

## Instance Values

```csharp
static void Main()
{
  new Thread (Go).Start();      // Call Go() on a new thread
  Go();                         // Call Go() on the main thread
}

static void Go()
{
  // Declare and use a local variable - 'cycles'
  for (int cycles = 0; cycles < 5; cycles++) Console.Write ('?');
}

// ??????????
```

A separate copy of the cycles variable is created on each thread's memory stack, and so the output is ten question marks.

## Reference Values

Threads share data if they have a common reference to the same object instance. For example:

```csharp
class ThreadTest
{
  bool done;

  static void Main()
  {
    ThreadTest tt = new ThreadTest();   // Create a common instance
    new Thread (tt.Go).Start();
    tt.Go();
  }

  // Note that Go is now an instance method
  void Go()
  {
     if (!done) { done = true; Console.WriteLine ("Done"); }
  }
}

// Done
```

Because both threads call `Go()` on the same `ThreadTest` instance, they share the done field. This results in "Done" being printed once instead of twice:

```csharp
class ThreadTest
{
  static bool done;    // Static fields are shared between all threads

  static void Main()
  {
    new Thread (Go).Start();
    Go();
  }

  static void Go()
  {
    if (!done) { done = true; Console.WriteLine ("Done"); }
  }
}
```

## Lambda Variables

Local variables captured by a lambda expression or anonymous delegate are converted by the compiler into fields, and so can also be shared:

```csharp
class ThreadTest
{
    static void Main()
    {
    bool done = false;
    ThreadStart action = () =>
    {
        if (!done) { done = true; Console.WriteLine ("Done"); }
    };
    new Thread (action).Start();
action(); }
}
```

## Static Variables

Static fields offer another way to share data between threads:

```csharp
class ThreadTest
{
  static bool _done;
  static void Main()
  {
// Static fields are shared between all threads
// in the same application domain.
    new Thread (Go).Start();
Go(); }
  static void Go()
  {
    if (!_done) { _done = true; Console.WriteLine ("Done"); }
  }
}
```

Both of these examples illustrate another key concept: that of thread safety (or rather, lack of it!) The output is actually indeterminate: it’s possible (though unlikely) that “Done” could be printed twice. If, however, we swap the order of statements in the Go method, the odds of “Done” being printed twice go up dramatically:

```csharp
static void Go()
{
  if (!done) { Console.WriteLine ("Done"); done = true; }
}
// Done
// Done   (usually!)
```

The problem is that one thread can be evaluating the if statement right as the other thread is executing the WriteLine statement—before it’s had a chance to set done to true.
