# Thread methods

## Managing a Thread

Once a new thread is started, there are a number of properties and methods that can be called to manage it.

### Properties

`IsAlive` property returns true until the thread ends.
`Thread.CurrentThread` gives you the currently executing thread.
`ThreadState` property check if a thread is blocked.
A thread's `Priority` property determines how much execution time it gets relative to other threads.

### Thread.Join()

The `Join()` method makes a thread to finish its work and makes other thread to halt until it finishes.

### Thread abort

To stop a thread, you can use the `Thread.Abort` method. However, because this method is executed by another thread, it can happen at any time, and can potentially leave a corrupt state and make your application unusable.

### Thread Sleep

`Thread.Sleep` is used to suspend the execution of a current thread for a specified number of milliseconds.

```csharp
static void MyThreadMethod()
{
    Console.WriteLine("Start of MyThread");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        //suspend the thread for 100 milliseconds
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        Console.Write("{0} ", i);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("End of MyThread");
}

static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Start of Main Thread");

    //Instantiate a thread
    Thread myThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(MyThreadMethod));

    //Start the execution of thread
    myThread.Start();

    //Main Thread wait until mythread terminated
    myThread.Join();

    Console.WriteLine("Main Method");
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        //Suspend the thread for 100 milliseconds
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        Console.Write("{0} ", i);
    }
    Console.WriteLine();
    Console.WriteLine("End of Main Thread");
}
// Output:
// Start of Main Thread
// Start of MyThread
// 1 2 3 4
// End of MyThread
// Main Method
// 1 2 3 4
// End of Main Thread
```

## Retrieving Thread information

You can use the `Thread.CurrentThread` class to ask for information about the thread that’s executing. This is called the thread’s execution context. This property gives you access to properties like the thread’s current culture (a CultureInfo associated with the current thread that is used to format dates, times, numbers, currency values, the sorting order of text, casing conventions, and string comparisons), principal (representing the current security context), priority (a value to indicate how the thread should be scheduled by the operating system), and other info.

When a thread is created, the runtime ensures that the initiating thread’s execution context is ﬂowed to the new thread. This way the new thread has the same privileges as the parent thread.

This copying of data does cost some resources, however. If you don’t need this data, you can disable this behavior by using the `ExecutionContext.SuppressFlow` method.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;

public class Example
{
   static Object obj = new Object();

   public static void Main()
   {
        // thread #1
        ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(ShowThreadInformation); 

        // thread #2
        var th1 = new Thread(ShowThreadInformation);
        th1.Start();

        // thread #3
        var th2 = new Thread(ShowThreadInformation);
        th2.IsBackground = true;
        th2.Start();
        Thread.Sleep(500);

        // thread #4
        ShowThreadInformation(null);
   }

   private static void ShowThreadInformation(Object state)
   {
      lock (obj) {
         var th  = Thread.CurrentThread;
         Console.WriteLine("Managed thread #{0}: ", th.ManagedThreadId);
         Console.WriteLine("   Background thread: {0}", th.IsBackground);
         Console.WriteLine("   Thread pool thread: {0}", th.IsThreadPoolThread);
         Console.WriteLine("   Priority: {0}", th.Priority);
         Console.WriteLine("   Culture: {0}", th.CurrentCulture.Name);
         Console.WriteLine("   UI culture: {0}", th.CurrentUICulture.Name);
         Console.WriteLine();
      }
   }
}
// The example displays output like the following:
//       Managed thread #6:
//          Background thread: True
//          Thread pool thread: False
//          Priority: Normal
//          Culture: en-US
//          UI culture: en-US
//
//       Managed thread #3:
//          Background thread: True
//          Thread pool thread: True
//          Priority: Normal
//          Culture: en-US
//          UI culture: en-US
//
//       Managed thread #4:
//          Background thread: False
//          Thread pool thread: False
//          Priority: Normal
//          Culture: en-US
//          UI culture: en-US
//
//       Managed thread #1:
//          Background thread: False
//          Thread pool thread: False
//          Priority: Normal
//          Culture: en-US
//          UI culture: en-US

## States of a Thread

| State         | Explanation                                         |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Unstarted     | Thread is created but not started yet               |
| Running       | Thread is executing a program                       |
| WaitSleepJoin | Thread is blocked due to Wait, Sleep or Join method |
| Suspended     | Thread is suspended                                 |
| Stopped       | Thread is stopped, either normally or aborted       |

## ThreadPriority

Threadpriority defines how much CPU time a thread will have for execution. When a thread is created, initially it is assigned with Normal priority. A thread can be assigned with any of the following priorities:

| Priority    | Explanation                                              |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| High        | Thread will schedule before threads with any priority    |
| AboveNormal | Thread will schedule before Threads with Normal priority |
| Normal      | Will schedule before Threads with BelowNormal priority   |
| BelowNormal | Thread will schedule before Threads with Lowest priority |
| Lowest Will | schedule after Threads with BelowNormal priority         |

This becomes relevant only when multiple threads are simultaneously active.
