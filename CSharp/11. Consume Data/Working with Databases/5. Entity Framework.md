# Entity framework

## The Entity Framework can be used with a few different approaches

1. Database First You want to map an existing database to your object structure.
2. Model First You want to design your object model with a graphical designer and then create a database that supports it.
3. Code First You create your object model in code and then generate a database that can store your data.

Read data using EF:

```csharp
//Database object
SchoolDB db = new SchoolDB();

//LINQ query to get students
var students = (from p in db.Students
select p).ToList();

foreach (var student in students)
{
    Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + student.StudentID);
    Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + student.StudentName);
}
```

Insertion of data using EF:

```csharp
//Database object
SchoolDB db = new SchoolDB();

//Add new Student
Student st = new Student();
st.StudentID = 3;
st.StudentName="Mubashar Rafique";

db.Students.Add(st);
db.SaveChanges();

Console.WriteLine("Student Added!");
```

Find, Update, and Delete using EF:

```csharp
//Database object
SchoolDB db = new SchoolDB();
//Find specific Studnet by ID (let say id is 2)
var std = (from p in db.Students
where p.StudentID == 2
select p).FirstOrDefault();

if (std != null)//if student is found
{
    //Show the record
    Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + std.StudentID + " Name is: " + std.StudentName);
}

if (std != null)//if student is found
{
    //update the record.
    std.StudentName = "Updated Name";
    db.SaveChanges();
}

if (std != null)//if student is found
{
    //delete the record
    db.Students.Remove(std);
    db.SaveChanges();
}
```

These operations performed using other layers (connected and disconnected) are far easier to perform using this layer. And the developers who havenâ€™t much knowledge about SQL or are bothered by the connected or disconnected layer have a better choice to interact with a database using EF.
