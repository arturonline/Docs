# 3.2 Modify Data Disconnected layer

Disconnected architecture means, you donâ€™t need to connect always when you want to get data from the database. You can get data from dataset; basically DataSet is a collection of datatables. We can store the database table, view data in the DataSet and can also store the xml value in dataset and get it if required.

To achieve this you need to use DataAdapter which work as a mediator between Database and DataSet.

## DataAdapter (disconnected model)

`DataAdapter` is used to execute `SQL statements` to populate the results into a `DataSet` or `DataTable`.
`DataAdapter` is bit slower compared to `DataReader`. It can be traversed in both *Forward* and *Backward* directions.
`DataAdapter` makes use of the `Fill()` function to populate the rows of `SQL statement` into a DataSet or DataTable.
`DataAdapter` manages the connection internally and does not require to open or close connections explicitly.

### DataSet

DataSet is mainly used to fetch and hold the records for one or more tables into memory. Those tables are `DataTable` objects made up of rows and columns of data and the relation between them.

A `DataAdapter` is used to populate `DataSet` from records returned from an `SQL statement` and also a `DataSet` can be created in memory and tables and data can be added to it.

DataSet can also be converted and saved as XML file.

### DataTable

A `DataTable` can hold records of a single Table consisting of rows and columns.

```csharp
string constring = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["constr"].ConnectionString;
using (SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(constring))
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT Name, City FROM Persons", con))
    {
        cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
        using (SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd))
        {
            DataSet ds = new DataSet();
            sda.Fill(ds);
            foreach (DataRow row in ds.Tables[0].Rows)
            {
                string name = row["Name"].ToString();
                string city = row["City"].ToString();
                Response.Write("Name: " + name);
                Response.Write("City: " + city);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
string constring = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["constr"].ConnectionString;
using (SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(constring))
{
    using (SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand("SELECT Name, City FROM Persons", con))
    {
        cmd.CommandType = CommandType.Text;
        using (SqlDataAdapter sda = new SqlDataAdapter(cmd))
        {
            DataTable dt = new DataTable();
            sda.Fill(dt);
            foreach (DataRow row in dt.Rows)
            {
                string name = row["Name"].ToString();
                string city = row["City"].ToString();
                Response.Write("Name: " + name);
                Response.Write("City: " + city);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
