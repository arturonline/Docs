# Transactions

When working with a database, things can go wrong. Maybe you are executing multiple queries that should be grouped together. If the last one fails, the previous ones are already executed, and suddenly your data can go corrupt.

Because of this, .NET Framework helps you with **transactions**. A transaction consists of a single command or a group of commands that execute as a package. Transactions allow you to combine multiple operations into a single unit of work. If a failure occurs at one point in the transaction, all of the updates can be rolled back to their pre-transaction state.

When working with transactions, it’s easiest to use the TransactionScope class. TransactionScope offers an easy way to work with transactions without requiring you to interact with the transaction itself.

```csharp
string connectionString = ConfigurationManager.
ConnectionStrings[“ProgrammingInCSharpConnection”].ConnectionString;

using (TransactionScope transactionScope = new TransactionScope())
{
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        SqlCommand command1 = new SqlCommand(
        "INSERT INTO People ([FirstName], [LastName], [MiddleInitial]) VALUES(‘John’, ‘Doe’, null)", connection);

        SqlCommand command2 = new SqlCommand(
        "INSERT INTO People ([FirstName], [LastName], [MiddleInitial]) VALUES(‘Jane’, ‘Doe’, null)", connection);

        command1.ExecuteNonQuery();
        command2.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
    transactionScope.Complete();
}
```

If an exception occurs inside the TransactionScope, the whole transaction is rolled back. If nothing goes wrong, you use TransactionScope.Complete to complete the transaction. It’s important to use the TransactionScope inside a using statement so that it is automatically disposed of when it’s no longer necessary.
