# Commands and Parameters

After establishing a connection to a data source, you can execute commands and return results from the data source using a `DbCommand` object. You can create a command using one of the command constructors for the .NET Framework data provider you are working with: `OleDbCommand` object, `SqlCommand` object, `OdbcCommand` object, and `OracleCommand` object.

## SqlCommand

ADO.NET provides the class `SqlCommand`, used to execute statements (commands/queries) against the database. By using this class, you can execute insert, delete, update, or stored procedure commands.

```csharp
string command = "select * from Student";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con);
```

`SqlCommand` requires a command (statement/query) to execute and a connection (connection string) on which a written command is going to execute. This code knows which command to execute on which connection (in other words, what to do using which path).

## Executing a Command

To execute a command you need to use one of this methods, depending on the result:

| Command            | Return Value                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ExecuteReader`    | Returns a DataReader object.                                  |
| `ExecuteScalar`    | Returns a single scalar value.                                |
| `ExecuteNonQuery`  | Executes a command that does not return any rows.             |
| `ExecuteXMLReader` | Returns an XmlReader. Available for a SqlCommand object only. |

### ExecuteNonQuery

`ExecuteNonQuery` is a method performed on a Command (`SqlCommand`) object used to execute the statement specified by a Command object and does not return result set(s) but a number of rows affected in a database by query execution. It is basically called on a Command object, having the query of `insert`, `delete`, and `update`. These queries do not return any record but a number of rows affected; that’s why these types of queries are executed by `ExecuteNonQuery` Method.

```csharp
string connectionString = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";
SqlConnection con = new SqlConnection(connectionString);
con.Open();

string command = "Insert into Student values(1,'Hamza Ali')";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con);
int result = cmd.ExecuteNonQuery();
con.Close();
if (result > 0)
    Console.WriteLine("Data is Inserted");
else
    Console.WriteLine("Error while inserting");

// This code basically inserts data in a Student table. ExecuteNonQuery() returns the number of affected rows.
```

### ExecuteScalar

The `ExecuteScalar` method is also performed on a Command’s object in a case where you write queries that return a single value. This is the case in which you use aggregate functions in your queries.

```csharp
string con = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";

string command = "select count(*) from Student";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con);
var noOfStudents = cmd.ExecuteScalar();
con.Close();
Console.WriteLine(noOfStudents);

// ExecuteScalar returns a single value of type Object which you can cast on the corresponding type
```

### ExecuteReader

The `ExecuteReader` method is also called on a Command’s object where you need to retrieve the data, i.e., in the case of a “select” query. This method returns an SqlDataReader object that remains connected to a database the whole time the reader is open. SqlDataReader is a forward-only resultset, which means you cannot move to any previous record and can read one record at a time. You can read the specific column of a table by index number or column name. 

```csharp
string con = "YOUR CONNECTION STRING HERE";

string command = "select * from Student";
SqlCommand cmd = new SqlCommand(command, con);

SqlDataReader reader = cmd.ExecuteReader();

int StudentID = 0;
string StudentName = null;
if (reader.HasRows)
{
    while (reader.Read())
    {
        StudentID = int.Parse(reader[0].ToString());//0 index means first clm in the table which is StudentID
        StudentName = reader["StudentName"].ToString();//it will fetch the value of provided clm name
    }
}
reader.Close();
con.Close();

Console.WriteLine("ID is: " + StudentID);
Console.WriteLine("Name is: " + StudentName);
```

SqlDataReader provides some properties like HasRows (to check if an `SqlDataReader` object has a row/rows or not), `FieldCount`, `IsClosed`, `Item[Int32]`, and `Item[string]`.
The last two properties are indexers which we have used in the above example. These are used to fetch a specific column value based on its `name(string)` or index `number(int)`.
`Read()` method reads the record from a database and is ready to read for the next, while the loop iterates and execution takes place for the next record and so on until there is the last record and the loop ends.

You must close the reader object and then close the connection object. Forgetting to close the connection can hurt performance. You can use the `Using` block to avoid such things.

### ExecuteXMLReader

The ExecuteXmlReader method is also called on a Command’s object and is the same as ExecuteReader but the difference is that it returns an XmlReader object used to represent data as XML.

## Configuring parameters

Because a SQL query is nothing more than a simple string, you might be tempted to concatenate multiple strings together to create your query. However, be aware that this is a huge security risk. For example, let’s say that you have a form in which people can fll in their names
that you will insert into the People table. Your query will look something like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO People VALUES(‘John’, ‘Doe’, null)
```

Now, you could read the values that a user enters and then manually construct this string. But what would happen if a user enters the following for a middle name?

```sql
‘); DELETE FROM People; --
```

After executing this query, all data in your People table would be deleted. This security hole is known as SQL injection.

To guard against SQL injection, you should never directly use user input in your SQL strings. Instead of manually building the correct SQL query, you can use parameterized SQL statements.

```csharp
public async Task InsertRowWithParameterizedQuery()
{
    string connectionString = ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ProgrammingInCSharpConnection"].ConnectionString;

    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
    {
    SqlCommand command = new SqlCommand(
    "INSERT INTO People([FirstName], [LastName], [MiddleName]) VALUES(@firstName, @lastName, @middleName)", connection);
    await connection.OpenAsync();

    command.Parameters.AddWithValue(“@firstName”, “John”);
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue(“@lastName”, “Doe”);
    command.Parameters.AddWithValue(“@middleName”, “Little”);

    int numberOfInsertedRows = await command.ExecuteNonQueryAsync();
    Console.WriteLine(“Inserted {0} rows”, numberOfInsertedRows);
    }
}
```
