# Using web services

Another option beyond storing data in a relational database or a file is to use an external service to store data. It can be a web service that you created or it can come from a third party.

With such services, you can exchange data between applications in a loosely coupled way. You only need to know the service address and how to make a request to that service. How the service gets its data is completely hidden from you, and you generally donâ€™t have to
worry about it.

The .NET framework provides the facility to develop such services. You can develop this kind of service using:

1. ASMX Service.
1. WCF (Windows Communication Foundation)

## ASMX web services

There are two main steps:

### 1. Create the web service

```csharp
namespace WebServiceInCSharp
{
    [WebService(Namespace = "http://tempuri.org/")]
    [WebServiceBinding(ConformsTo = WsiProfiles.BasicProfile1_1)]
    [System.ComponentModel.ToolboxItem(false)]
    // To allow this Web Service to be called from script, using ASP.NET AJAX, uncomment the
    following line.
    // [System.Web.Script.Services.ScriptService]
    public class SampleService : System.Web.Services.WebService
    {
        [WebMethod]
        public string HelloWorld()
        {
        return "Hello World";
        }

        [WebMethod]
        public int Add(int a,int b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }

        [WebMethod]
        public int Subtract(int a,int b)
        {
            return a - b;
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Consume the service

```csharp
//Create the proxy for your service to use its methods
MyService.SampleServiceSoapClient proxy = new MyService.SampleServiceSoapClient();

int addResult = proxy.Add(5, 10);
int subtractResult = proxy.Subtract(100, 40);

Console.WriteLine("Addition Result is: " + addResult);
Console.WriteLine("Subtraction Result is: " + subtractResult);
```

## WCF

A WCF service looks like a regular class. It can have methods with return types, constructors,
and other members. The only difference with a regular class are the attributes on the class itself and on its methods that inform the .NET Framework you want to expose your class as a service.

```csharp
[ServiceContract]
public class MyService
{
    [OperationContract]
    public string DoWork(string left, string right)
    {
        return left + right;
    }
}
```

When building a WCF service, you usually start with the contract, which defnes which operations your service exposes. The contract is what the outside world expects of your service.
After specifying your contract, you specify the bindings. A binding confgures the protocols
and transports that can be used to call your service. Maybe your service can be used over
HTTP, HTTPS, and a named-pipe connection. You next need to specify the address, which is
the endpoint that your service exposes. Doing this ensures that there is a physical network
address that can be used to call your service with a specifc binding.

## WCF web service vs. ASMX Web Service

| WCF Service                                                                            | ASMX Service                               |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| 1. WCF service can be hosted in IIS, WAS, Console, WCF Provided Host                   | 1. ASMX service can just be hosted in IIS. |
| 2. It supports multiple communication protocols i.e., HTTP, TCP, MSMQ, and NamedPipes. | 2. It supports only HTTP.                  |
| 3. It uses DataContractSerializer.                                                     | 3. It uses XmlSerializer.                  |
