# Consume XML and JSON

XML and JSON are mainly used for communication over the network between different applications or different platforms. We will discuss these two formats of passing messages/data over the Internet with a brief description.

## XML Data

Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that consists of a set of rules that defne how a document should be formatted. The advantage of XML is that it can be read by both humans and computer programs.

There should be a single root element that contains the rest of the information. This way, you create a hierarchical tree that defnes the relationship between all elements. Underneath the root element are other child elements. A child element can be a single element that describes some characteristic or several elements that group other elements. Elements can contain attributes, which are name-value pairs associated with an element. An XML document can also contain comments and special processing instructions.

Parsing an XML fle as if it were a regular text fle is a lot of work. The .NET Framework helps
you out by providing classes that can be used to parse, create, and edit XML fles—both in
memory and on disk.

| Name           | Description                                                                                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XmlReader      | A fast way of reading an XML fle. You can move forward only through the file, and nothing is cached. |
| XmlWriter      | A fast way to create an XML fle. Just as with the XmlReader, it’s forward only and noncached.        |
| XmlDocument    | Represents an in-memory XML document. It supports navigating and editing a document.                 |
| XPathNavigator | Helps with navigating through an XML document to fnd specifc information.                            |

For example, we have a sample XML file and want to read this data:

```xml
<Student>
    <ID>1</ID>
    <Name>Hamza Ali</Name>
</Student>
```

To read the above XML using XmlReader:

```csharp
string xml = @"<Student>
                <ID>1</ID>
                <Name>Hamza Ali</Name>
                </Student>";

//to read xml string as a stream
StringReader sReader = new StringReader(xml);

//reader needs xml data as stream (xmlReader is ready)
XmlReader xReader = XmlReader.Create(sReader);

while (xReader.Read())//Read the entire xml
{
    Console.WriteLine(xReader.Value);
}
```

You can also use XmlDocument to read XML:

```csharp
//to read xml string as a stream
StringReader sReader = new StringReader(xml);

XmlDocument doc = new XmlDocument();
doc.Load(sReader);
foreach (XmlNode item in doc.DocumentElement)
{
    Console.WriteLine(item.InnerText);
}
```

Write XML data using XmlWriter:

```csharp
//Stream to store xml
StringWriter stream = new StringWriter();
using (XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(stream, new XmlWriterSettings() { Indent = true
}))//Indent to space between elements
{
    writer.WriteStartDocument();//Star Doc
    writer.WriteStartElement("Student");//write Element "Student"
    writer.WriteAttributeString("ID", "1");//Student's attribute "ID" with value 1
    writer.WriteElementString("Name", "Hamza Ali"); //"Name" element inside Student
    with inner text "Hamza Ali"
    writer.WriteEndElement();
}
Console.WriteLine(stream.ToString());//show written xml
```

## JSON Data

Another popular format used by many web services is JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). Although XML is useful, it is verbose and has many rules regarding a document’s structure. JSON is what’s called the “fat-free” alternative to XML. It has an easier grammar and often carries signifcantly less weight.

 Normally, your data is automatically serialized for you when you use a WCF AJAX endpoint or ASP.NET WebApi. When you want to execute this serialization manually, you can use the `DataContractJsonSerializer`.

### Using Data Contract Json Serializer

Like `DataContractSerializer`, `DataContractJsonSerializer` provides a `WriteObject()` method for serialization and a `ReadObject()` method for deserialization. The rest of the procedure for JSON Serialization is the same as the others. It is mainly used with WCF.

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Teacher
{
    [DataMember]
    private int id = 1;
    [DataMember]
    public string name { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public long salary { get; set; }
}

//Serialization
DataContractJsonSerializer dataContract = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.json", FileMode.Create))
{
    dataContract.WriteObject(stream, t); // Writes all the object data to an JSON document or stream.
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");

//Deserialization
Teacher teacher = null;
DataContractJsonSerializer dataContract = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.json", FileMode.Open))
{
    teacher = (Teacher)dataContract.ReadObject(stream);
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```

Serialized Object:

```json
{"id":1,"name":"Ahsan","salary":20000}
```
