# Value types vs Reference types

## Value types

There are two categories of value types: `struct` and `enum`.

The built-in numeric types (ex: *int*) are *structs*, and they have properties and methods that you can access.

Value types are sealed, which means, for example, that you cannot derive a type from `int` and you cannot define a struct to inherit from any user-defined class or struct because a struct can only inherit from `System.ValueType`.

+ Value types
  + Simple Types
  + Signed integral: sbyte, short, int, long
  + Unsigned integral: byte, ushort, uint, ulong
  + Unicode characters: char
  + IEEE floating point: float, double
  + High-precision decimal: decimal
  + Boolean: bool
+ Enum types
  + User-defined types of the form enum E {...}
+ Struct types
  + User-defined types of the form struct S {...}
+ Nullable value types
  + Extensions of all other value types with a null value

## Reference types

A type that is defined as a `class`, `delegate`, `array`, or `interface` is a reference type. At run time, when you declare a variable of a reference type, the variable contains the value `null` until you explicitly create an object by using the new operator, or assign it an object that has been created elsewhere.

Reference types fully support inheritance. When you create a class, you can inherit from any other interface or class that is not defined as sealed, and other classes can inherit from your class and override your virtual methods.

+ Reference types
  + Class types
    + Ultimate base class of all other types: object
    + Unicode strings: string
    + User-defined types of the form class C {...}
  + Interface types
    + User-defined types of the form interface I {...}
  + Array types
    + Single- and multi-dimensional, for example, int[] and int[,]
  + Delegate types
    + User-defined types of the form delegate int D(...)
