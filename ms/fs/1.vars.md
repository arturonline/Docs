# vars

- let binds a value to a name.
- let bindings are immutable by default.

```f#
let number = 2

/// A mutable binding.  This is required to be able to mutate the value of 'otherNumber'.
let mutable otherNumber = 2

// Note that '=' is not the same as this.  Outside binding values via 'let', '=' is used to test equality.
otherNumber <- otherNumber + 1
```

## Types

```f#
/// This is a sample integer.
let sampleInteger = 176

/// This is a sample floating point number.
let sampleDouble = 4.1

/// This computed a new number by some arithmetic.  Numeric types are converted using
/// functions 'int', 'double' and so on.
let sampleInteger2 = (sampleInteger/4 + 5 - 7) * 4 + int sampleDouble

/// This is a list of the numbers from 0 to 99.
let sampleNumbers = [ 0 .. 99 ]

/// This is a list of all tuples containing all the numbers from 0 to 99 and their squares.
let sampleTableOfSquares = [ for i in 0 .. 99 -> (i, i*i) ]

// The next line prints a list that includes tuples, using an interpolated string.
printfn $"The table of squares from 0 to 99 is:\n{sampleTableOfSquares}"

/// Operators on booleans are 'not', '&&' and '||'.
    let boolean3 = not boolean1 && (boolean2 || false)
```
