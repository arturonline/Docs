# Razor Pages

Razor is a markup syntax for embedding server-based code into webpages. The Razor syntax consists of Razor markup, C#, and HTML. Files containing Razor generally have a .cshtml file extension.

## Razor syntax

Razor uses the `@` symbol to transition from HTML to C#. When an `@` symbol is followed by a Razor reserved keyword, it transitions into Razor-specific markup. Otherwise, it transitions into plain C#.

We can find Razor code in three different ways:

1. **Implicit Expressions**: start with `@` followed by C# code and must not contain spaces.


    ```csharp
    <p>@DateTime.Now</p>
    <p>@DateTime.IsLeapYear(2016)</p>
    ```

2. **Explicit Expressions**: consist of an `@` symbol between parenthesis. Any content within the `@()` parenthesis is evaluated and rendered to the output.

    ```csharp
    <p>Last week this time: @(DateTime.Now - TimeSpan.FromDays(7))</p>
    ```

    ```csharp
    @{
        var joe = new Person("Joe", 33);
    }

    <p>Age@(joe.Age)</p>

    // <p>Age33</p>
    ```

3. **Blocks of code**: Razor code blocks start with `@` and are enclosed by `{}`. Unlike expressions, C# code inside code blocks isn't rendered. Code blocks and expressions in a view share the same scope and are defined in order:

    ```csharp
    @{
        var quote = "The future depends on what you do today. - Mahatma Gandhi";
    }

    <p>@quote</p>

    @{
        quote = "Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. - Martin Luther King, Jr.";
    }

    <p>@quote</p>

    //<p>The future depends on what you do today. - Mahatma Gandhi</p>
    // <p>Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that. - Martin Luther King, Jr.</p>
    ```

    The default language in a code block is C#, but the Razor Page can transition back to HTML implicitly:

    ```csharp
    @{
        var inCSharp = true;
        <p>Now in HTML, was in C# @inCSharp</p>
    }
    ```

    to render HTML that isn't surrounded by an HTML tag surround the characters for rendering with the Razor `<text>` tag:

    ```csharp
    @for (var i = 0; i < people.Length; i++)
    {
        var person = people[i];
        <text>Name: @person.Name</text>
    }
    ```

    To render the rest of an entire line as HTML inside a code block, use the @: syntax:

    ```csharp
    @for (var i = 0; i < people.Length; i++)
    {
        var person = people[i];
        @:Name: @person.Name
    }
    ```

## Comments

```csharp
@{
    /* C# comment */
    // Another C# comment
}

// <!-- HTML comment -->
```

Razor comments are removed by the server before the webpage is rendered. Razor uses @* *@ to delimit comments. The following code is commented out, so the server doesn't render any markup:

```csharp
@*
    @{
        /* C# comment */
        // Another C# comment
    }
    <!-- HTML comment -->
*@
```
