# Razor Pages

The default Razor language is HTML. Razor supports C# and uses the @ symbol to transition from HTML to C#. Razor evaluates C# expressions and renders them in the HTML output.

- `@page` must be the first Razor directive on a page.
- `@page` affects the behavior of other Razor constructs.
- Razor Pages file names have a `.cshtml` suffix.

## Razor expressions

- **Implicit Expresions:** Start with `@` followed by C# code without containing spaces. It also can't contain generics.

```cs
<p>@DateTime.IsLeapYear(2016)</p>
```

- **Explicit Expresions:** consist of an `@` symbol with balanced parenthesis.

```cs
<p>Last week this time: @(DateTime.Now - TimeSpan.FromDays(7))</p>
```

## Razor code blocks

Razor code blocks start with `@` and are enclosed by `{}`. Unlike expressions, C# code inside code blocks isn't rendered. Declare local functions to serve as templating.
