# Resources in Xamarin.Forms

## Resources

A resource is any object that can be shared across your UI. The most common examples are fonts, colors, and sizes. However, you can also store complex objects such as Style and OnPlatform instances as resources.

A resource is like a symbolic constant from a programming language. You define it in one place and reference it everywhere you need it.

### Define a resource

```xml
<!-- Example: repeted value blue  -->
<Label TextColor="Blue" FontSize="14">
<Button TextColor="Blue" FontSize="14">

<!-- Define a resource for blue value -->
<Color x:Key="PageControlTextColor">Blue</Color>

<!-- Store the resource in the page dictionary -->
<Page.Resources>
    <Color x:Key="PageControlTextColor">Blue</Color>
</Page.Resources>

```

### Use resources

```xml
<!-- Apply a resource by using StaticResource -->
<Label TextColor="{StaticResource PageControlTextColor}" ... />
```

#### #1. Static Resource

```xml
<!-- Apply a resource by using StaticResource -->
<Label TextColor="{StaticResource PageControlTextColor}" ... />
```

#### #2. Dynamic Resource

It's similar to `StaticResource` in that it does a dictionary lookup when the target object is created. But it also listens for changes to the resource in the dictionary. If the resource value in the dictionary changes, `DynamicResource` automatically updates the UI.

```xml
<ContentPage ...>
    <Page.Resources>
        <Color x:Key="PanelBackgroundColor">Blue</Color>
    </Page.Resources>

    <StackLayout BackgroundColor="{DynamicResource PanelBackgroundColor}">
    ...
    </StackLayout>
</ContentPage>
```

### Update resources from Code

Suppose you want to change the value of the PanelBackgroundColor resource while the application is running. You'd write code in your page's code-behind file to access the Resources property. The following example shows how you'd update the resource value to a different color.

```cs
this.Resources["PanelBackgroundColor"] = Color.Green;
```
