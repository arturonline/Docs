# Entity FrameWork

Entity Framework is an ORM Framework.

Before Using the Entity framework, you need to know about the various terms used in the entity framework.

- **Entity**: Represents a row in the database
- Properties: Represents a Column.
- **Entity Type / Entity Sets**: Represents is the table.
- **Association**: Represents the relationship between two entity types.
- **Entity Key**: Represents a Primary key.

## Accesing the Data

In the EF you donâ€™t access the database. You will query the conceptual data model for the data. You can do this using LINQ to Entities or Entity SQL:

- **LINQ to Entities**
- **Lambdas**

## Models

There are two ways you can create the Entity data model (EDM) using the designer

- **Model First** => In this approach models are created first and database later.
- **Database first** =>  models are created first and database later.
