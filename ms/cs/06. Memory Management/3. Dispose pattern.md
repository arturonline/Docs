# Dispose Unmanaged Resources

In a .NET framework, garbage collector automatically handle the life cycle of a managed resource. But it can't automatically handle the life cycle of an unmanaged resource; we must explicitly release resources of unmanaged resources to handle them manually. Some common unmanaged resources are: open a file, database connection, or network connection, etc.

## Implement IDisposable to Release Unmanaged Resource

Types that use unmanaged resources must implement `IDisposable` to reclaim the unmanaged memory. IDisposable defines a single methods: `Dispose()`.

IDisposable Definition:

```csharp
//Provides a mechanism for releasing unmanaged resources.
public interface IDisposable
{
    void Dispose();
}
```

To prevent garbage collector from calling an object's finalizer (Destructor), dispose method uses `GC.SuppressFinalize` method.

Dispose method can be called by following two ways:

1. try/finally block
2. using statement

### 1. Call Dispose Inside try/finally Block

 inside a try/finally block.

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class myClass : IDisposable
{
    public StreamReader reader;

    public void Dispose()
    {
    //Cleanup unmanaged resources
    if (reader != null)
        reader.Dispose();

    GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
}
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        myClass obj = null;
        try
        {
            obj = new myClass();
        }
        finally
        {
            //call dispose method
            obj.Dispose();
        }
    }
}
```

### 2. Call Dispose Inside Using Statement

When a type implements an IDisposable interface, its dispose method must call anywhere in the code to reclaim memory of an unmanaged resource. C# introduced using statement, which can only be used with types that implement an IDisposable interface; it automatically calls Dispose method after the using statement ends (when control goes out of the using block {}).

Syntax

```csharp
using(type variableName = new type())
{
//TODO:
}
```

```csharp
// Implement IDisposable
using System;
using System.IO;

class myClass : IDisposable
{
    public StreamReader reader;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        //Cleanup unmanaged resources
        if (reader != null)
            reader.Dispose();

        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);

        Console.WriteLine("Disposed");
    }
}
class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        using (myClass obj = new myClass())
        {

        }
        Console.WriteLine("End");
    }
}
// Output:
// Disposed
// End
```

## Disposable pattern

Disposable pattern is a standard way to implement `IDisposable` interface. The below code snippet is the general pattern for implementing the dispose pattern. The bool value disposed determines whether the dispose method was invoked. The parameterless `Dispose()` method is used to free unmanaged resources and to indicate that there is a finalizer it doesn't have to run. The `Dispose(bool)` indicates whether the method was called from a parameterless Dispose method or it was called from a finalizer (destructor)

```csharp
using System;
using System.IO;

class myClass : IDisposable
{
    // create a variable to keep track of whether Dispose has been called
    bool _disposed = false;

    // Public implementation of Dispose pattern callable by consumers.
    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }
```

```csharp
    //Finalizer a.k.a Destructor
    ~myClass()
    {
        Dispose(false);
    }
```

```csharp
    // type uses unmanaged resource
    StreamReader reader;

    // Protected implementation of Dispose pattern.
    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (_disposed)
            return;

        if (disposing)
        {
            if(reader != null)
            reader.Dispose();
            // Free any other managed objects here.
        }
        // Free any unmanaged objects here.
        _disposed = true;
    }

}
```
