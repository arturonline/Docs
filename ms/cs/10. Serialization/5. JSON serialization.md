# JSON serialization

There are two ways to serializa JSON:

- Using a DataContract
- Using JavaScriptSerializer

## Using Data Contract Json Serializer

JSON is a special format that is specifcally useful when sending small amounts of data between a web server and a client. Normally, your data is automatically serialized for you when you use a WCF AJAX endpoint or ASP.NET WebApi. When you want to execute this serialization manually, you can use the `DataContractJsonSerializer`.

Like `DataContractSerializer`, `DataContractJsonSerializer` provides a `WriteObject()` method for serialization and a `ReadObject()` method for deserialization. The rest of the procedure for JSON Serialization is the same as the others. It is mainly used with WCF.

```csharp
[DataContract]
public class Teacher
{
    [DataMember]
    private int id = 1;
    [DataMember]
    public string name { get; set; }
    [DataMember]
    public long salary { get; set; }
}

//Serialization
DataContractJsonSerializer dataContract = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.json", FileMode.Create))
{
    dataContract.WriteObject(stream, t); // Writes all the object data to an JSON document or stream.
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");
```

```csharp
//Deserialization
Teacher teacher = null;
DataContractJsonSerializer dataContract = new DataContractJsonSerializer(typeof(Teacher));
using (var stream = new FileStream("Sample.json", FileMode.Open))
{
    teacher = (Teacher)dataContract.ReadObject(stream);
}

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```

Serialized Object:

```json
{"id":1,"name":"Ahsan","salary":20000}
```

## Using JavaScriptSerializer

```csharp
private class Teacher
{
    private int id { get; set; }
    public string name { get; set; }
    public long salary { get; set; }
}

//Serialization
JavaScriptSerializer dataContract = new JavaScriptSerializer();
string serializedDataInStringFormat = dataContract.Serialize(steacher);

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Serialized!");

//Deserialization
Teacher dteacher = null;

dteacher = dataContract.Deserialize<Teacher>(serializedDataInStringFormat);

Console.WriteLine("Data has been Deserialized!");
```
