# Create and monitor performance counters

## Performance Counters

Windows keeps a watch of the processes and services that are running in your system by tracking of the threads that are currently in execution, the CLR memory, etc. You would often need to measure the performance of computer systems or the applications running on them according to metrics like for the resource consumption in the system, services running on the system, or the performance of the devices attached to the system.

The PerformanceCounter component can be used for both reading existing predefined or custom counters and publishing (writing) performance data to custom counters.

The counter is the mechanism by which performance data is collected. The registry stores the names of all the counters, each of which is related to a specific area of system functionality. Examples include a processor's busy time, memory usage, or the number of bytes received over a network connection.

All performance counters are part of a category, and within that category they have a unique name. To access the performance counters, your application has to run under full trust, or the account that it’s running under should be an administrator or be a part of the Performance Monitor Users group.
All performance counters implement IDisposable because they access unmanaged resourc- es. After you’re done with the performance counter, it’s best to immediately dispose of it.

These performance counters are managed by Windows like EventLogs and you can view them by using the `Perfmon.exe` program.

### Creating the Performance Counter There are two ways to create Performance Counter

1. Using Server Explorer
2. Using Code

C# provides a class, `PerformanceCounterCategory` class, to create Performance Counter, and `PerformanceCounter` to interact with them. You can also create manual performance counters using Server-Explorer.

```csharp
if (!PerformanceCounterCategory.Exists("ShoppingCounter"))
{
    CounterCreationDataCollection counters = new  CounterCreationDataCollection();
    /* 1. counter for counting totals(ShoppingDone): PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32 */
    CounterCreationData totalDone = new CounterCreationData();
    totalDone.CounterName = "ShoppingDone";
    totalDone.CounterHelp = "Total number of Shoppings Done";
    totalDone.CounterType = PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32;
    counters.Add(totalDone);

    /* 2. counter for counting totals (ShoppingNotDone): PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32
    */
    CounterCreationData totalNotDone = new CounterCreationData();
    totalNotDone.CounterName = "ShoppingNotDone";
    totalNotDone.CounterHelp = "Total number of Shoppings not Done";
    totalNotDone.CounterType = PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32;
    counters.Add(totalNotDone);

    // create new category with the counters above
    PerformanceCounterCategory.Create("ShoppingCounter",
    "Shopping counters help out to montior how many shoppings are done and how  many are not.", counters);
    Console.WriteLine("Performance Counter Created.");
}
else
Console.WriteLine("Performance Counter already Created.");
```

`PerformanceCounterCategory` class is used to create the performance counters for a specific Category. It takes a list of counters to create. It is also used to delete the performance counter or check the existence of them. Performance counters are defined for a specific category using `CounterCreationData` class. `CounterCreationDataCollection` takes the instances of CounterCreationData class.

After creating Performance Counter, these should be used to monitor the performance of an application.

```csharp
// successfully Done shpping (Counter)
PerformanceCounter successfullCounter = new PerformanceCounter();
successfullCounter.CategoryName = "ShoppingCounter";
successfullCounter.CounterName = "ShoppingDone";
successfullCounter.MachineName = ".";
successfullCounter.ReadOnly = false;

// Not successfully Done shopping ( Counter)
PerformanceCounter NotsuccessfullCounter = new PerformanceCounter();
NotsuccessfullCounter.CategoryName = "ShoppingCounter";
NotsuccessfullCounter.CounterName = "ShoppingsNotDone";
NotsuccessfullCounter.MachineName = ".";
NotsuccessfullCounter.ReadOnly = false;

int noOfShoppingsDone = 15;

int noOfShoppingsNotDone = 20;

for (int i = 0; i < noOfShoppingsDone; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Shopping Done Successfully..");
  successfullCounter.Increment();
}
for (int i = 0; i < noOfShoppingsNotDone; i++)
{
  Console.WriteLine("Shoppings Not Done..");
  NotsuccessfullCounter.Increment();
}
```

### Types

Performance counters come in several different types. The type definition determines how the counter interacts with the monitoring applications. Some types that can be useful are the following:

* *NumberOfItems32/NumberOfItems64* These types can be used for counting the number of operations or items. NumberOfItems64 is the same as NumberOfItems32, except that it uses a larger field to accommodate for larger values.
* *RateOfCountsPerSecond32/RateOfCountsPerSecond64* These types can be used to calculate the amount per second of an item or operation. RateOfCountsPerSecond64 is the same as RateOfCountsPerSecond32, except that it uses larger fields to accommo- date for larger values.
* *AvergateTimer32* Calculates the average time to perform a process or process an item.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
namespace PerformanceCounters
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            if (CreatePerformanceCounters())
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Created performance counters");
                Console.WriteLine("Please restart application");
                Console.ReadKey();
                return;
            }
            var totalOperationsCounter = new PerformanceCounter(
                "MyCategory",
                "# operations executed",
                "",
                false);
            var operationsPerSecondCounter = new PerformanceCounter(
                "MyCategory",
                "# operations / sec",
                "", false);
            totalOperationsCounter.Increment();
            operationsPerSecondCounter.Increment();
        }
        private static bool CreatePerformanceCounters()
        {
            if (!PerformanceCounterCategory.Exists("MyCategory"))
            {
                CounterCreationDataCollection counters =
                    new CounterCreationDataCollection
                {
                    new CounterCreationData(
                        "# operations executed",
                        "Total number of operations executed",
                        PerformanceCounterType.NumberOfItems32),
                    new CounterCreationData(
                        "# operations / sec",
                        "Number of operations executed per second",
                        PerformanceCounterType.RateOfCountsPerSecond32)
                };
                PerformanceCounterCategory.Create("MyCategory",
                        "Sample category for Codeproject", counters);
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
    }
}
```

    //    Description - This counter type shows how many items are processed, on average,

    //        of items processed during the last sample interval and the denominator (D)
    //        represents the number of operations completed during the last two sample
    //        intervals.
