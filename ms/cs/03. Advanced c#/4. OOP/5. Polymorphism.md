# Polymorphism

## Static Polymorphism

Polymorphism in programming is all about changing behavior. While static polymorphism means changing behavior of methods at compile time, it is also known as early binding.

In C#, static polymorphism can be implemented with two ways:

1. Method Overloading
2. Operator Overloading

### Method Overloading

Inside type (class, struct) definition we can have multiple methods of the same name but with different parameters; this is called method overloading.

In C#, we can overload a method by two ways:

1. By parameter types
2. By length of parameters

#### By parameter types

```csharp
class Calculator
{
    public void Add(int a, int b)
    {
        int result = a + b;
        Console.WriteLine("Sum of ints = {0}",result);
    }

    public void Add(string a, string b)
    {
        string result = a + b;
        Console.WriteLine("Sum of strings = {0}", result);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Calculator cal = new Calculator();
        cal.Add(1, 2);
        cal.Add("C", "Sharp");
    }
}
//Output:
// Sum of ints = 3
// Sum of strings = CSharp
```

#### By length of parameters

```csharp
class Program
{
    public void Show(string name)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name = {0}", name);
    }

    public void Show(string name, int age)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name = {0} - Age = {1}", name, age);
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Program program = new Program();
        program.Show("Ali");
        program.Show("Ali", 22);
    }
}
//Output:
// Name = Ali
// Name = Ali - Age = 22
```

### Operator Overloading

In C#, we can overload the definition of an operator for custom types (class, struct). To overload the definition of an operator, we define special methods inside a custom type. These methods help the compiler to distinguish among different meanings of an operator that produce different results for a different type.

Generally, in C# we can overload three kinds of operators:

1. Unary Operators
2. Binary Operators
3. Comparison Operators

#### Unary Operators

Unary operator operates on a single operand `(+, -, !, ++, --, true, false)`. These are unary operators which can be overloaded in C#.

```csharp
// Syntax
public static return_type operator op (Type t)
{
// TODO:
}
```

```csharp
class Distance
{
    public int meter { get; set; }

    public static Distance operator ++ (Distance dis )
    {
        dis.meter += 1;
        return dis;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Distance distance = new Distance();
        distance.meter = 5;
        distance++;
        Console.WriteLine(distance.meter);
    }
}
```

#### Binary Operator

Binary operator operates on two operands `(+, -, *, /, %, &, |, ^, <<, >>)`. These are Binary operators which can be overloaded in C#.

```csharp
public static return_type operator op (Type1 t1, Type2 t2)
{
//TODO:
}
```

```csharp
class Student
{
    public int Marks { get; set; }
    // + Operator Overloading Method

    public static Student operator + (Student s1, Student s2)
    {
        Student std = new Student();
        std.Marks = s1.Marks + s2.Marks;
        return std;
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Student s1 = new Student { Marks = 10 };
        Student s2 = new Student { Marks = 20 };
        Student s3 = s1 + s2;
        Console.WriteLine(s3.Marks);
    }
}
//Output
```

### Comparison Operator

Comparison operator operates on two operands and returns Boolean value when it compares left-sided operand’s value with right-sided operand’s value `(==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)`. These are comparison operators which can be overloaded in C#.

```csharp
public static bool operator op (Type1 t1, Type2 t2)
{
//TODO:
}
```

```csharp
class Distance
{
    public int meter { get; set; }

    public static bool operator < (Distance d1, Distance d2 )
    {
        return (d1.meter < d2.meter);
    }
    public static bool operator > (Distance d1, Distance d2)
    {
        return (d1.meter > d2.meter);
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Distance d1 = new Distance { meter = 10 };
        Distance d2 = new Distance { meter = 20 };

        if(d1 < d2)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("d1 is less than d2");
        }
        else if(d2 < d1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("d2 is less than d1");
        }
    }
}
```

## Dynamic Polymorphism

Polymorphism in programming is all about changing behavior, while dynamic polymorphism means changing behavior of an object at runtime by overriding the definition of a method. It is also known as late binding.

In C#, method is overridden by two ways:

1. Virtual method
2. Abstract method

### Virtual method

Virtual is a keyword used with method in base class to define a virtual method. Virtual method has a definition of its method; its derived class can inherit or override its definition. Thus, when calling the method name the runtime will determine which method to invoke.

```csharp
virtual return_type methodName()
{
//TODO:
}
```

Example:

```csharp
class Vehicle
{
    public virtual void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Run Vehicle");
    }
}

class Bike : Vehicle
{
    public override void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Bike Run");
    }
}

    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Vehicle vc = new Bike();
            vc.Run();
        }
}
```

### Abstract method

Abstract is a keyword used with method in abstract class to declare an abstract method. Unlike virtual method, abstract method doesn’t have its definition of method. Thus, its derived class must implement the definition of abstract method, otherwise compile time error will generate. Abstract methods always declare inside an abstract class.

```csharp
abstract class_Name
{
    public abstract Type Method();
}
```

```csharp
abstract class Vehicle
{
    public abstract void Run();
}

class Bike : Vehicle
{
    public override void Run()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Run Bike");
    }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Vehicle vc = new Bike();
        vc.Run();
    }
}
```
