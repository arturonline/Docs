# Catching Exceptions

An exception can be handled by writing a code (that might throw an error at runtime) inside a `try-catch` or a `try-catch-finally` block. The following examples show a try-catch statement, a try-finally statement, and a try-catch-finally statement.

```csharp
try
{
    // Code to try goes here.
}
catch (SomeSpecificException ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception goes here.
    // Only catch exceptions that you know how to handle.
    // Never catch base class System.Exception without
    // rethrowing it at the end of the catch block.
}
```

```csharp
try
{
    // Code to try goes here.
}
finally
{
    // Code to execute after the try block goes here.
}
```

```csharp
try
{
    // Code to try goes here.
}
catch (SomeSpecificException ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception goes here.
}
finally
{
    // Code to execute after the try (and possibly catch) blocks
    // goes here.
}
```

>A try block without a catch or finally block causes a compiler error.

## Catch Blocks

After an exception is thrown, the runtime checks the current statement to see whether it is within a try block. If it is, any catch blocks associated with the try block are checked to see whether they can catch the exception. Catch blocks typically specify exception types; if the type of the catch block is the same type as the exception, or a base class of the exception, the catch block can handle the method.

A try statement can contain more than one catch block. The first catch statement that can handle the exception is executed; any following catch statements, even if they are compatible, are ignored. Therefore, when stacking multiple catch blocks, we use the most specific exception type on the first catch block and use the least specific exception type at the last catch block.

It is important to position catch blocks with the most specific (that is, the most derived) exception types first.

```csharp
using System;
namespace DemoProject
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Divide(1, 0, "Result = ");
            }
            catch (DivideByZeroException)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Divide by zero exception");
            }
            catch (NullReferenceException)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Null reference exception");
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
            finally {
                Console.WriteLine("Program Ends");
            }
        }
        private static void Divide(int a, int b, string s)
        {
            int result = a / b;
            Console.WriteLine(s.ToUpper() + result);
        }
    }
}
// Output:
// Divide by zero exception
// Program Ends
```

## Finally Blocks

A finally block enables you to clean up actions that are performed in a try block. If present, the finally block executes last, after the try block and any matched catch block. A finally block always runs, regardless of whether an exception is thrown or a catch block matching the exception type is found.

The finally block can be used to release resources such as file streams, database connections, and graphics handles without waiting for the garbage collector in the runtime to finalize the objects.

In the following example, the finally block is used to close a file that is opened in the try block. Notice that the state of the file handle is checked before the file is closed:

```csharp
System.IO.FileStream file = null;
System.IO.FileInfo fileinfo = new System.IO.FileInfo("C:\\file.txt");
try
{
    file = fileinfo.OpenWrite();
    file.WriteByte(0xF);
}
finally
{
    // Check for null because OpenWrite might have failed.
    if (file != null)
    {
        file.Close();
    }
}
```

## FailFast

There is one other situation that you can use to prevent a finally block from running. Of course, this isn’t something you want to use on a regular basis, but you may have a situation in which just shutting down the application is safer than running finally blocks.

Preventing the finally block from running can be achieved by using `Environment.FailFast`. This method has two different overloads, one that only takes a string and another one that also takes an exception. When this method is called, the message (and optionally the exception) are written to the Windows application event log, and the application is terminated.

```csharp
using System;
namespace ExceptionHandling
{
    public static class Program
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            string s = Console.ReadLine();
            try
            {
                int i = int.Parse(s);
                if (i == 42) Environment.FailFast(“Special number entered”);
            }
            finally
            {
                Console.WriteLine(“Program complete.”);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The line Program Complete won’t be executed if 42 is entered. Instead the application shuts down immediately.

## Creating Custom Exceptions

In C#, a custom exception can be created by inheriting the System.Exception class. Generally, custom exceptions are useful in large-scale projects where multiple modules are talking to each other.

Syntax:

```csharp
using System;

namespace DemoProject
{
    class MyCustomException : System.Exception
    {
        //Overload constructor if you want
        public MyCustomException(string message) : base(message)
        {
            //TODO: Provide definition if you want
        }
    }
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            try
            {
                Show();
            }
            catch (MyCustomException ex)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);
            }
        }
        private static void Show()
        {
            throw new MyCustomException("It's a custom exception!");
        }
    }
}
// Output:
// It's a custom exception!
```
