# Tasks

A task represents a single asynchronous operation. Compared to a thread, a Task is higher-level abstraction-it represents a concurrent operation that may or may not be backed by a thread. Tasks doesn’t create new threads, instead it efficiently manages the threads of a `threadpool`. Tasks are executed by `TaskScheduler`, which queues tasks onto threads.

A task that does not return a value is represented by the `Task` class. A task that returns a value is represented by the `Task<TResult>` class.

Task provides the following powerful features over thread and threadpool:

1. Task allows you to return a result.
2. It gives better programmatical control to run and wait for a task.
3. It reduces the switching time among multiple threads.
4. It gives the ability to chain multiple tasks together and it can execute each task one after the other by using `ContinueWith()`.
5. It can create a parent/child relationship when one task is started from another task.
6. Task can cancel its execution by using cancellation tokens.
7. Task leaves the CLR from the overhead of creating more threads; instead it implicitly uses the thread from threadpool.
8. Asynchronous implementation is easy in task, by using “async” and “await” keywords.
9. Task waits for all of the provided Task objects to complete execution.

## Creating tasks

When you create a task, you give it a *delegate* that encapsulates the code that the task will execute. The delegate can be expressed as a *named delegate*, an *anonymous method*, or a *lambda expression*.

The following example shows the three options for declaring the Task object along with the console output.

```csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
     //1. Action delegate
     Task task1 = new Task(new Action(HelloConsole));

     //2. anonymous function
     Task task2 = new Task(delegate
     {
          HelloConsole();
     });

     //3. lambda expression
     Task task3 = new Task(() => HelloConsole());

    private static void HelloConsole()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello From My Task");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            Console.Write("{0} ", i);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Bye From My Task");
    }
}

task1.Start();
task2.Start();
task3.Start();

Console.WriteLine("Main method complete. Press any key to finish.");
```

As you see, to start a task you should use the `Start()` method.

We know Task performs on the background threads of a thread pool. Therefore, it’s important to write a `wait()` method, otherwise the program will shut down as soon the Main Thread finishes its exeuction.

```Csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        //initialize mytask and assign
        //a unit of work in form of 'myMethod()'
        Task myTask = new Task(myMethod);
        myTask.Start();// Start the execution of mytask

        myTask.Wait(); //Wait until mytask finish its job

        //It's the part of Main Method
        Console.WriteLine("Bye From Main Thread");
    }

    private static void myMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello From My Task");
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            Console.Write("{0} ", i);
        }
        Console.WriteLine();
        Console.WriteLine("Bye From My Task");
        }
    }
}

// Output:
// Hello From My Task
// 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
// Bye From My Task
// Bye From Main Thread
```

## Creating and running a task

The Task `Run()` method provides a simple way to **create** and **start** a task using default values:

```csharp
uusing System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Example
{
   public static async Task Main()
   {
      await Task.Run( () => {
                // Just loop.
                int ctr = 0;
                for (ctr = 0; ctr <= 1000000; ctr++)
                {}
                Console.WriteLine("Finished {0} loop iterations", ctr);
            } );
   }
}
// The example displays the following output:
//        Finished 1000001 loop iterations
```

An alternative method to start a task is the static `TaskFactory.StartNew` method. The `Task.Factory` property returns a `TaskFactory` object. Overloads of the `TaskFactory.StartNew` method let you specify parameters to pass to the task creation options and a task scheduler. In .NET 4.5, it is preferable to use `Task.Run` because it manages Task more efficiently than `Task.Factory.StartNew`.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      Task t = Task.Factory.StartNew( () => {
                                  // Just loop.
                                  int ctr = 0;
                                  for (ctr = 0; ctr <= 1000000; ctr++)
                                  {}
                                  Console.WriteLine("Finished {0} loop iterations", ctr);
                               } );
      t.Wait();
   }
}
// The example displays the following output:
//        Finished 1000001 loop iterations
```

>For performance reasons, the `Task.Run` or `TaskFactory.StartNew` method is the preferred mechanism for creating and scheduling computational tasks, but for scenarios where creation and scheduling must be separated, you can use the constructors and then call the `Task.Start` method to schedule the task for execution at a later time.

## Returning a value

The `Task<TResult>` class represents a single operation that returns a value and that usually executes asynchronously.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Task<int> myTask = new Task<int>(myMethod);
        myTask.Start(); //start myTask

        Console.WriteLine("Hello from Main Thread");

        //Wait the main thread until myTask is finished
        //and returns the value from myTask operation (myMethod)
        int i = myTask.Result;

        Console.WriteLine("myTask has a return value = {0}", i);
        Console.WriteLine("Bye From Main Thread");
    }

    static int myMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from myTask<int>");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);

        return 10;
    }
}
// Output:
// Hello from Main Thread
// Hello from myTask<int>
// myTask has a return value = 10
// Bye From Main Thread
```

More examples:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Task<int> myTask = Task.Run<int>(new Func<int>(myMethod));
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from Main Thread");
        //Wait for the main thread until myTask is finished
        //and return the value from myTask operation (myMethod)
        int i = myTask.Result;
        Console.WriteLine("myTask has a return value = {0}", i);
        Console.WriteLine("Bye From Main Thread");
    }
    static int myMethod()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello from myTask<int>");
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
return 10; }
}

// Hello from Main Thread
// Hello from myTask<int>
// myTask has a return value = 10
// Bye From Main Thread
```

Attempting to read the Result property on a Task will force the thread that’s trying to read the result to wait until the Task is finished before continuing. As long as the Task has not finished, it is impossible to give the result. If the Task is not finished, this call will block the current thread.
