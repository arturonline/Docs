# Wait for One or More Task

## Task.Wait( )

The thread pool uses background threads, and these do not block the process from existing. To wait for a single task to complete, you can call its `Task.Wait` method. It blocks the calling thread until the specified task completes its execution.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Task myTask = Task.Run(() =>
    {
        Thread.Sleep(1000);
        Console.WriteLine("Task completed after 1 Sec");
    });

    Console.WriteLine("Hello From Main Thread");
    myTask.Wait();// wait until myTask get completed

    Console.WriteLine("Bye From Main Thread");
  }
}
// Output:
// Hello From Main Thread
// Task completed after 1 Sec
// Bye From Main Thread
```

## WaitAll()

WaitAll is a static method of Task class. You can also call `WaitAll()` to wait for multiple tasks to finish before continuing execution.

```Csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Task tsk1 = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            Console.WriteLine("tsk1 completed");
        });

        Task tsk2 = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            Console.WriteLine("tsk2 completed");
        });

        Task tsk3 = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Thread.Sleep(10000);
            Console.WriteLine("tsk3 completed");
        });

        //Store reference of all tasks in an array of Task
        Task[] allTasks = { tsk1, tsk2, tsk3 };

        //Wait for all tasks to complete
        Task.WaitAll(allTasks);

        Console.WriteLine("By from main thread");
    }
}
// Output:
// tsk1 completed
// tsk2 completed
// tsk3 completed
// By from main 0 thread
```

### Task.WaitAll Overloads

```csharp
WaitAll(Task[])
```

Waits for all of the provided Task objects to complete execution.

```csharp
WaitAll(Task[], Int32)
```

Waits for all of the provided Task objects to complete execution within a specified number of milliseconds.

```csharp
WaitAll(Task[], CancellationToken)
```

Waits for all of the provided Task objects to complete execution unless the wait is cancelled.

```csharp
WaitAll(Task[], TimeSpan)
```

Waits for all of the provided cancellable Task objects to complete execution within a specified time interval.

```csharp
WaitAll(Task[], Int32, CancellationToken)
```

Waits for all of the provided Task objects to complete execution within a specified number of milliseconds or until the wait is cancelled.

## WaitAny

Task.WaitAny is a static method of Task class. It blocks the execution of a calling thread until any first task from a collection of tasks completes its execution.
Code Snippet

```csharp
//Store reference of all task in an array of Task
Task[] allTasks = { tsk1, tsk2, tsk3 };

//Wait for all tasks to complete
Task.WaitAny(allTasks);
Console.WriteLine("By from main thread");
```

### Task.WaitAny Overloads

```csharp
WaitAny(Task[], Int32, CancellationToken)
```

Waits for any of the provided Task objects to complete execution within a specified number of milliseconds or until a cancellation token is cancelled.

```csharp
WaitAny(Task[], TimeSpan)
```

Waits for any of the provided Task objects to complete execution within a specified time interval.

```csharp
WaitAny(Task[], Int32)
```

Waits for any of the provided Task objects to complete execution within a specified number of milliseconds.

```csharp
WaitAny(Task[], CancellationToken)
```

Waits for any of the provided Task objects to complete execution unless the wait is cancelled.

```csharp
WaitAny(Task[])
```

Waits for any of the provided Task objects to complete execution.

## Task.Delay(milisec)

Unlike `Thread.Sleep`, `Task.Delay` doesnâ€™t block the current thread. Instead it makes a logical delay for a specified period of time. Task.Delay is intended to run asynchronously. `Await` is used with `Task.Delay` because it returns a Task.

```csharp
private async void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    label1.Text = "Hello World";
    await Task.Delay(3000);
    label1.Text = "Bye World";
}
```

### Task.Delay Overloads

```csharp
Delay(TimeSpan, CancellationToken)
```

Creates a cancellable task that completes after a specified time interval.

```csharp
Delay(Int32, CancellationToken)
```

Creates a cancellable task that completes after a specified number of milliseconds.

```csharp
Delay(Int32)
```

Creates a task that completes after a specified number of milliseconds.

```csharp
Delay(TimeSpan)
```

Creates a task that completes after a specified time interval.
