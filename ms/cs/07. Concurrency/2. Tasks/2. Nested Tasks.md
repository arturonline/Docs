# Nested Tasks

## Attached and Detached Child Tasks

A **child task** (or nested task) is a `Task` instance that is created in the user delegate of another task, which is known as the **parent task**. A child task can be either detached or attached:

* A **detached child task** is a task that executes independently of its parent.
* An **attached child task** is a nested task that is created with the `TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent` option whose parent does not explicitly or by default prohibit it from being attached.

The following table lists the basic differences between the two kinds of child tasks.

| Category                                            | Detached child tasks | Attached child tasks |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| Parent waits for child tasks to complete.           | No                   | Yes                  |
| Parent propagates exceptions thrown by child tasks. | No                   | Yes                  |
| Status of parent depends on status of child.        | No                   | Yes                  |

In most scenarios, we recommend that you use detached child tasks, because their relationships with other tasks are less complex.

The following example shows a parent task that creates one simple nested task:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      var parent = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
         Console.WriteLine("Outer task executing.");

         var child = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
            Console.WriteLine("Nested task starting.");
            Thread.SpinWait(500000);
            Console.WriteLine("Nested task completing.");
         });
      });

      parent.Wait();
      Console.WriteLine("Outer has completed.");
   }
}
// The example produces output like the following:
//        Outer task executing.
//        Nested task starting.
//        Outer has completed.
//        Nested task completing.
```

## Child Task Attached to Parent

Unlike detached child tasks, attached child tasks are closely synchronized with the parent. You can change the detached child task in the previous example to an attached child task by using the TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent option in the task creation statement, as shown in the following example. In this code, the attached child task completes before its parent. As a result, the output from the example is the same each time you run the code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

public class Example
{
   public static void Main()
   {
      var parent = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
            Console.WriteLine("Parent task executing.");
            var child = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => {
                  Console.WriteLine("Attached child starting.");
                  Thread.SpinWait(5000000);
                  Console.WriteLine("Attached child completing.");
            }, TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent);
      });
      parent.Wait();
      Console.WriteLine("Parent has completed.");
   }
}
// The example displays the following output:
//       Parent task executing.
//       Attached child starting.
//       Attached child completing.
//       Parent has completed.
```

However, a child task can attach to its parent only if its parent does not prohibit attached child tasks. Parent tasks can explicitly prevent child tasks from attaching to them by specifying the TaskCreationOptions.DenyChildAttach option in the parent task's class constructor or the TaskFactory.StartNew method.
