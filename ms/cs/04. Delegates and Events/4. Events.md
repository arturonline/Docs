# Events

Events enable a class or object to notify other classes or objects when something of interest occurs.

* The clas that sends (or raises) the event is called *publisher*
* The classes that receive (or handle) the event are called *subscribers*

You can subscribe to an event and then you are notifed when the publisher of the event raises a new event.

## Observer pattern

Events have the following properties:

* The `publisher` determines **when** an event is raised;
* The `subscribers` determine **what** action is taken in response to the event.
* An event can have multiple `subscribers`. A subscriber can handle multiple events from multiple `publishers`.
* When an event has multiple subscribers, the event handlers are invoked `synchronously` when an event is raised.

## Differences between delegate and event

An Event declaration adds a layer of abstraction and protection on the delegate instance. This protection prevents clients of the delegate from resetting the delegate and its invocation list and only allows adding or removing targets from the invocation list.

1. Event encapsulates a delegate; it avoids overwriting of a method reference by restricting the use of assignment `=` operator.
2. Unlike delegate, event cannot be invoked outside the class is created, which makes sure event will only invoke when a certain codition satisfies.

### Syntax

(Prior to C# 2.0)

```csharp
// Delegate definition
public delegate void PriceChangedHandler (decimal oldPrice, decimal newPrice);

public class Broadcaster
{
    // Event declaration
    public event PriceChangedHandler PriceChanged;
}
```

The .NET Framework provides an event that is pre-wired to a delegate, `EventHandler` and the generic version `EventHandler<>`:

(Modern C#)

```csharp
public class Stock
{
...
public event EventHandler<PriceChangedEventArgs> PriceChanged;
}
```

## Example 1

```Csharp
using System;

namespace test{

    class MyTestApp{
        //The Event Handler declaration
        public delegate void EventActionHandler();

        //The Event
        public event EventActionHandler OnEventActions;

        //An Action
        public void Hello(){
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World of events!");
        }
        //Another Action
        public void Goodbye(){
            Console.WriteLine("Goodbye Cruel World of events!");
        }

        public static void Main(){
            MyTestApp TestApp = new MyTestApp();

            //Add actions to the collection
            TestApp.OnEventActions += TestApp.Hello;
            TestApp.OnEventActions += TestApp.Goodbye;

            //Invoke all event actions:
            if (TestApp.OnEventActions!= null){
                TestApp.OnEventActions();
                //If there would be no subscribers, the OnEventActions would be null
            }
        }
    }
}
```

we can do the invoke in a modern way:

```csharp
OnEventActions?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty)
```
