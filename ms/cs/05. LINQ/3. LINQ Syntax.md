# LINQ Syntax

LINQ provides two ways to to query data sources:

1. Method Syntax
2. Query Syntax

## Method Syntax

Also known as Lambda Syntax Query, as the extension method uses lambda syntax for predicate.

Syntax:

```csharp
result = DataSource.Operator(<lambda expression>);
// OR
result = DataSource.Operator(<lambda expression>).Operator(<optional>);
```

Example:

```csharp
string[] fruits = new string[]
{
    "Apple","Mango","Strawberry","Date",
    "Banana","Avocado","Cherry","Grape",
    "Guava","Melon","Orange","Tomato"
};

int fruitsLength = fruits.Where(p => p.StartsWith("A")).Count();
```

## Query Syntax

It is the same as using SQL for rational database. Query in this syntax always ends with a `select` or `group..by` operator and starts with a `from` keyword.

Syntax:

```csharp
<Returned resultâ€™s Type> result = from <range variable> in Data Source
                                            <Query Operators> <lambda expression>
                                    <select or groupBy operator> <result>
```

```csharp
string[] fruits = new string[]
{
    "Apple","Mango","Strawberry","Date",
    "Banana","Avocado","Cherry","Grape",
    "Guava","Melon","Orange","Tomato"
};

int result = (from p in fruits
        where p.StartsWith("A")
        select p).Count();
```
