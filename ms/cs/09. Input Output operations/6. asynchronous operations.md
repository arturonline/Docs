# Implementing asynchronous I/O operations

## async, await

Reading and writing of the file might be a time-consuming task and you have to wait a long time to finish the operation. The code in this chapter is called synchronous code. The code is executed line by line and often waits till the task ends. This wait can be long enough to annoy the user and put a severe impact on the user experience.

```csharp
//Write to the File
FileStream file = File.Create("Sample.txt");
StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter(file);
await writer.WriteAsync("Asynchronously Written Data");
writer.Close();

//Read From File
FileStream readFile = File.Open("Sample.txt", FileMode.Open);
StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(readFile);
string result = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

```csharp
// Executing an asynchronous HTTP request
public async Task ReadAsyncHttpRequest()
{
    HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
    string result = await client.GetStringAsync("http://www.microsoft.com");
}
```

## Running I/O operations in parallel

You can also write code that will execute operations in parallel.

```csharp
public async Task ExecuteMultipleRequestsInParallel()
{
HttpClient client = new HttpClient();

    Task microsoft = client.GetStringAsync("http://www.microsoft.com");
    Task msdn = client.GetStringAsync("http://msdn.microsoft.com");
    Task blogs = client.GetStringAsync("http://blogs.msdn.com/");

    await Task.WhenAll(microsoft, msdn, blogs);
}
```
