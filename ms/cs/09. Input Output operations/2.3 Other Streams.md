# Other Streams

## Memory Stream

MemoryStream creates a stream whose backing store is memory.

```csharp
// Use of MemoryStream

MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
string content = "This is file content";
byte[] contentInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

//Write into file
memoryStream.Write(contentInBytes, 0, contentInBytes.Length);

//Set the position to the begninig of stream
memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

//Read from file
byte[] readContent = new byte[memoryStream.Length];
int count= memoryStream.Read(readContent, 0, readContent.Length);
for (int i =count; i < memoryStream.Length; i++)
{
    readContent[i] = Convert.ToByte(memoryStream.ReadByte());
}
string result= Encoding.UTF8.GetString(readContent);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```

## BufferedStream

Adds a buffering layer to read and write operations on another stream.

A buffer is a block of bytes in memory used to cache data, thereby reducing the number of calls to the operating system. Buffers improve read and write performance. A buffer can be used for either reading or writing, but never both simultaneously. The `Read` and `Write` methods of BufferedStream automatically maintain the buffer.

```csharp
FileStream fileStream = File.Create("Sample.txt");
BufferedStream memoryStream = new BufferedStream(fileStream);
string content = "This is file content";
byte[] contentInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

//Write into file
memoryStream.Write(contentInBytes, 0, contentInBytes.Length);

//Set the position to the begninig of stream
memoryStream.Seek(0, SeekOrigin.Begin);

//Read from file
byte[] readContent = new byte[memoryStream.Length];
int count= memoryStream.Read(readContent, 0, readContent.Length);
for (int i =count; i < memoryStream.Length; i++)
{
    readContent[i] = Convert.ToByte(memoryStream.ReadByte());
}
string result= Encoding.UTF8.GetString(readContent);
Console.WriteLine(result);
```


## FileStream

The `FileStream` class reads and writes to files. You need to create a `FileStream` object to create a new file or open an existing file.

The syntax for creating a `FileStream` object is as follows:

```csharp
FileStream <object_name> = new FileStream(<File_Name>,<FileMode>,<FileAccess>,<FileShare>)
```

**File_Name**: is the name of a file on which an operation will perform.
**FileMode**: is an enumeration that gives a different method to open the file:

1. `Append`: It Creates the file if the file does not exist and, if it exists, it puts the cursor at the end of the file.
2. `Create`: Creates a new file and, if the file already exists, it will override it.
3. `CreateNew`: Creates a new file and, if the file already exists, it will throw an exception.
4. `Open`: Opens the file.
5. `OpenOrCreate`: Opens the existing file; if itâ€™s not found, then it creates a new one.
6. `Truncate`: opens the existing file and truncates its size to zero bytes.

**FileAccess**: is an enumeration that gives a different method to access a file:

1. `Read`: tells the file has just read access.
2. `ReadWrite`: tells the file has read and write access.
3. `Write`: tells the file has just write access.

**FileShare**: is an enumetation that gives different methods:

1. `Delete`: Allows subsequent deleting of a file.
2. `Inheritable`: Allows the file to handle child process inheritance.
3. `None`: Stops to share the file. File must be closed before access by another process.
4. `Read`: Allows file for reading.
5. `ReadWrite`: Allows file for reading and writing.
6. `Write`: Allows file to write.

Example:

```csharp
// Use of FileStream to write content in a file

FileStream fileStream = new FileStream("File.txt",FileMode.Create,FileAccess.Write
,FileShare.Write);

string content = "This is file content";
byte[] contentInBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(content);

fileStream.Write(contentInBytes, 0, contentInBytes.Length);
fileStream.Close();
```

The `Write()` method takes three parameters containing the bytes of contents to write, the starting, and the ending position of bytes to write.
