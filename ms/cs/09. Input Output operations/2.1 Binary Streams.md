# Binary Streams

Binary streams, as their name suggests, work with binary (raw) data. The main classes that we use to read and write from and to binary streams are: FileStream, BinaryReader and BinaryWriter.

## BinaryReader and BinaryWriter

These classes are used to read and write values as Binary Values:

```csharp
//Write Data Types values as Binary Values in Sample.dat file

FileStream file = File.Create("Sample.dat");
BinaryWriter binaryWriter = new BinaryWriter(file);
binaryWriter.Write("String Value");
binaryWriter.Write('A');
binaryWriter.Write(true);
binaryWriter.Close();

//Read Binary values as respective data type's values from Sample.dat

FileStream fileToOpen = File.Open("Sample.dat", FileMode.Open);
BinaryReader binaryReader = new BinaryReader(fileToOpen);
Console.WriteLine(binaryReader.ReadString());
Console.WriteLine(binaryReader.ReadChar());
Console.WriteLine(binaryReader.ReadBoolean());
```

BinaryReader has methods to read a specific data typeâ€™s value. For example, if there is a string value in binary form then you use the `ReadString()` method and so on, but if there is no written value as binary and you want to read it then exception will be thrown.
