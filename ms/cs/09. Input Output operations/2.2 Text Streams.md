# Text Streams

> [Link](https://introprogramming.info/tag/streams-in-net/)

Text streams are very similar to binary, but only work with text data or rather a sequence of characters (char) and strings (string).
The main classes for working with text streams in .NET are `TextReader` and `TextWriter`. They are abstract base classes that deal exclusively with characters and strings. These classes define the basic functionality for reading and writing for the classes that inherit them.

Their more important methods are:

- `ReadLine()` – reads one line of text and returns a string.
- `ReadToEnd()` – reads the entire stream to its end and returns a string.
- `Write()` – writes a string to the stream.
- `WriteLine()` – writes one line of text into the stream.

## StreamReader

The stream reader is used to read data from a file using streams. The data from the file is first read into the stream. Thereafter the application reads the data from the stream.

For our example, we will assume that we have a file in the D drive called Example.txt. The file will be a simple text file and have 2 lines as shown below:

```cs

String path = @"D:\Example.txt";

using (StreamReader sr = File.OpenText(path))
{
    String s = "";

    while ((s = sr.ReadLine()) != null)
    {
    Console.WriteLine(s);
    }
}
Console.ReadKey();
```

## StreamWriter

The stream writer is used to write data to a file using streams. The data from the application is first written into the stream. After that the stream writes the data to the file. Let’s look at an example of how we can use streams for writing data from a file. Enter the below code in the program.cs file.

```cs
String path = @"D:\Example.txt";

using (StreamWriter sr = File.AppendText(path))
{
    sr.WriteLine("Guru99 - ASP.Net");
    sr.Close();

    Console.WriteLine(File.ReadAllText(path));
}
Console.ReadKey();
```

## StringReader and StringWriter

These classes are used to read and write characters to and from the string.

```csharp
//Write string or characters
StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();
stringWriter.Write("String Writer example");
stringWriter.Write(" Append Text");
Console.WriteLine(stringWriter.ToString());

//Read string
StringReader stringReader = new StringReader("String Reader Example");
Console.WriteLine(stringReader.ReadLine());
```

## StreamReader and StreamWriter

StreamReader is designed for reading lines of information from a standard text file.

```csharp
class FileReader
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an instance of StreamReader to read from a file
        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("Sample.txt");
        int lineNumber = 0;

        // Read first line from the text file
        string line = reader.ReadLine();

        // Read the other lines from the text file
        while (line != null)
        {
            lineNumber++;
            Console.WriteLine("Line {0}: {1}", lineNumber, line);
            line = reader.ReadLine();
        }

        // Close the resource after you've finished using it
        reader.Close();
    }
}
```

Automatic closing the Stream with `using`:

```csharp

class FileReader
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create an instance of StreamReader to read from a file
        StreamReader reader = new StreamReader("Sample.txt");

        using (reader)
        {
            int lineNumber = 0;

            // Read first line from the text file
            string line = reader.ReadLine();

            // Read the other lines from the text file
            while (line != null)
            {
                lineNumber++;
                Console.WriteLine("Line {0}: {1}", lineNumber, line);
                line = reader.ReadLine();
            }
        }
    }
}
```

```csharp
class FileWriter
{
    static void Main()
    {
        // Create a StreamWriter instance
        StreamWriter writer = new StreamWriter("numbers.txt");

        // Ensure the writer will be closed when no longer used
        using(writer)
        {
            // Loop through the numbers from 1 to 20 and write them
            for (int i = 1; i <= 20; i++)
            {
                writer.WriteLine(i);
            }
        }
    }
}

```
