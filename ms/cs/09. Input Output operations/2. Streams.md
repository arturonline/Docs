# Streams

A stream is an ordered sequence of bytes, which is send from one application or input device to another application or output device. These bytes are written and read one after the other and always arrive in the same **order** as they were sent. Streams are an abstraction of a data communication channel that connects two devices or applications.

## Devices or Aplications

Here are some commonly used stream classes:

- FileStream – for reading and writing to a file.
- IsolatedStorageFileStream – for reading and writing to a file in isolated storage.
- MemoryStream – for reading and writing to memory as the backing store.
- BufferedStream – for improving performance of read and write operations.
- NetworkStream – for reading and writing over network sockets.
- PipeStream – for reading and writing over anonymous and named pipes.
- CryptoStream – for linking data streams to cryptographic transformations.

## Adapters

A Stream deals only in bytes; to read or write data types such as strings, integers, or XML elements, you must plug in an adapter. Here’s what the Framework provides:

- Text adapters (for string and character data)
  - TextReader, TextWriter
  - StreamReader, StreamWriter
  - StringReader, StringWriter
- Binary adapters (for primitive types such as int, bool, string, and float)
  - BinaryReader, BinaryWriter
- XML adapters (covered in Chapter 11)
  - XmlReader, XmlWriter
