# Identifiers name

An identifier is the name you assign to a type (class, interface, struct, delegate, or enum), member, variable, or namespace. Valid identifiers must follow these rules:

* Identifiers must start with a letter, or `_`.
* Identifiers may contain Unicode letter characters, decimal digit characters, Unicode connecting characters, Unicode combining characters, or Unicode formatting characters.
* You can declare identifiers that match C# keywords by using the `@` prefix on the identifier. The `@` is not part of the identifier name. For example, `@if` declares an identifier named `if`. These `verbatim` identifiers are primarily for interoperability with identifiers declared in other languages.

## Naming conventions

In addition to the rules, there are a number of identifier naming conventions used throughout the .NET APIs. By convention, C# programs use PascalCase for type names, namespaces, and all public members. In addition, the following conventions are common:

* `Interface` names start with a capital I.
* `Attribute` types end with the word Attribute.
* `Enum` types use a singular noun for non-flags, and a plural noun for flags.
* Identifiers should not contain two consecutive `_` characters. Those names are reserved for compiler generated identifiers.
