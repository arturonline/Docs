# Boxing and UnBoxing

* Boxing is the conversion (copy and wrap) of a value type into a reference type.

    ```csharp
    int age = 22;
    object boxedAge = age; //Boxing
    ```

* Unboxing is vice versa, the conversion of a reference type into a value type. Unboxing requires Cast.

    ```csharp
    int count = 1;
    object countObject = count; // the count value was copied into the countObject variable, it was boxing
    count += 1; // count equals 2 already, and the countObject value is still 1
    count = (int)countObject; // now count also equals 1 â€“ it was unboxing
    ```

* The only other important thing to know is that when boxing and unboxing happen, you need to explicitly cast your object from a reference to a value type.

    ```cs
    int unboxedAge = (int)boxedAge; //explicitly cast Unboxing
    ```

## Confirming Conversion is valid: `is`, `as` operators

C# has both, the `is` operator and the `as` operator:

* The `is` operator returns `true` or `false`, depending on whether the conversion is allowed.
* The `as` operator explicitly returns the converted value or `null` if the conversion is not possible instead of raising an exception.

    ```csharp
    void OpenConnection(DbConnection connection)
    {
            if (connection is SqlConnection)
            {
            // run some special code
            }
    }

    void LogStream(Stream stream)
    {
        MemoryStream memoryStream = stream as MemoryStream;
        if (memoryStream != null)
        {
        // ....
        }
    }
    ```
